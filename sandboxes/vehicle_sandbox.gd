## A sandbox to play (ticket #54, V9): you are the player in an open concrete yard walled in, with a
## red car and a white van parked in it, furniture scattered about to shove, and a few dummies
## standing around. Nothing is asserted. Walk up to a door and press E to get in (the nearest door
## that can open: the car's four, the van's two cab doors, its sliding side door and its rear
## doors), drive, press E again to get out. Feel the drift under the handbrake, crash into the
## walls, plough through the furniture, nudge (or run down) a dummy, and shoot the bodywork to dent
## it.
