## A sandbox to play: you are the player in a furnished arena with every gun — pistol (3), SMG (5)
## and assault rifle (6) — plus fists (2), a few target dummies, and walls and furniture to press
## the barrel against. Nothing is asserted — compare the guns' fire rate (hold LMB for the
## automatics), damage and penetration (the rifle shoots through the east wall at the dummy behind
## it), see how each is held, and walk the rifle or SMG up to a wall or the chair to watch it come
## up and stop firing.
##
## The player also carries 3 stun (7) and 3 frag (8) grenades, thrown on LMB: 2 s after the last one
## goes off (none of the player's still live, no reload or throw under way) both are topped back up
## to 3, the range re-arming the player as Main arms a spawn (`Character.set_loadout`), which
## restocks the guns and their spare magazines too. West of where the player starts a dummy crouches
## against the far (west) face of a couch: lob a frag or a stun short of the couch to see it shield
## the crouched body (`docs/grenades.md` G7, G11), and one over it to see it does not.
##
## South of that is the armour range (docs/outfits.md): a firing line of nine numbered lanes, each
## ending at a dummy dressed in one outfit — plain clothes, a helmet, the tactical vest, the plate
## carrier empty and with each plate, the invaders' whole kit turned away and a ceramic carrier
## turned side on. Stand on a lane's mark and shoot its dummy to see what each outfit stops and lets
## through, watch a plate wear down, and compare a plate's front with its back (lane 8) and with a
## shot that takes it in the flank (lane 9). The label on the floor under each dummy keeps its
## outfit (the debug panel's wording), plate condition and health current. A shoved dummy walks back
## to its spot.
