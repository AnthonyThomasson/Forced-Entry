extends Node2D
## Navigation domain: an optional, draw-only debug overlay for the baked navigation map. It draws
## the furniture HOLES carved out of the navmesh — the grown solid-furniture footprints the bake
## added as obstructions, so paths route around them — and, in another colour, the holes the
## characters at rest leave in the steering map. It snapshots the holes via
## `NavBuilder.furniture_holes` (in `setup`), so the drawing matches the navmesh exactly. The
## snapshot follows the furniture: Main builds this once after the initial bake, and
## `nav_updater.gd` calls `setup` again after each re-bake so the overlay re-snapshots at the
## pieces' current positions. A single world-space node (the map is global, not per-NPC). It reads
## nothing back and feeds nothing in. Toggle with `show_holes`.

## Whether to draw the hole overlay at all, furniture and characters at rest. Off by default.
@export var show_holes: bool = false
## Fill colour of a carved hole.
@export var hole_color: Color = Color(1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
## Outline colour of a carved hole.

## Fill and outline colours of a hole a living character leaves in the steering map.
