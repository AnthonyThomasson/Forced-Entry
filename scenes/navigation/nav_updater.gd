extends Node
## Navigation domain: keeps the baked navigation map in step with furniture that has been shoved
## around. The holes `NavBuilder.build` carves are a snapshot of where the furniture stood at bake
## time; as pieces are bulldozed off their spots those holes go stale and paths route around empty
## floor. This node re-bakes the map on an interval (`NavBuilder._rebake_async`) so the holes follow
## the furniture's CURRENT positions and paths route around scattered objects. The living characters
## are holes in the STEERING region (`NavBuilder._rebake_steering`), so it follows them as they
## walk, appear and die. It only re-bakes when a piece or a character has actually moved past
## `move_threshold`, so an at-rest scene costs a cheap per-tick compare and no bake. The planning
## region only re-bakes for furniture. Bulldozing is still the behaviour BETWEEN re-bakes (and
## for non-solid decor, which is never carved). A script-only node the match builder builds once
## after the initial bake; imports nothing from other domains — it is handed plain Nodes.

## Whether the periodic re-bake runs at all. Off = the map stays the static bake-time snapshot.
