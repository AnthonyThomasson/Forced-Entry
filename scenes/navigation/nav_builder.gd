extends RefCounted
## Navigation domain (leaf): turns a generated house into a walkable navigation map for the
## global NavigationServer2D. It bakes one NavigationRegion2D whose walkable area is the house
## footprint minus the walls: the room rects give the footprint, and the house's STATIC colliders
## (the walls) are parsed as obstructions, so doorways — gaps in the walls — stay open. It also
## bakes each solid furniture footprint in as a hole (_add_furniture_holes), so paths route AROUND
## furniture and reroute through another doorway when the near one is blocked (and a piece sealing
## the only route leaves the far side unreachable). Any NavigationAgent2D pathfinds against this map
## automatically. Every living character at rest is carved out too (character_holes), so a path
## routes around a body standing in the way instead of into it. That is a second map: the default
## one (what the AI plans and measures with: routes, flank and entry geometry, snapping a point to
## open floor) holds the furniture only, and a STEERING map of its own, with a region baked with the
## characters as well, is what a NavigationAgent2D walks (see `steering_map`). Carving the
## characters into the one shared map would change every route the AI weighs against a hostile (the
## target's own hole bends it). Imports nothing from other domains — it reads a plain `rooms` array
## and a Node, and recognises furniture (RigidBody2D) and characters (CharacterBody2D) by engine
## type alone.
