## Character FOOTSTEPS (Character domain, animate layer): spots the instant each foot lands in the
## walk cycle. It reports the sole to the Physics domain's BloodFootprints, which decides whether it
## prints blood, and posts a `footfall` event on the EventBus (the Audio domain makes the step). A
## foot lands when its lift (max(-cos(phase), 0), see character_rig.gd) returns to the floor, i.e.
## cos(phase) rises through zero, at the forward end of its stride. Stepped by character.gd after
## the pose each physics frame; one rig solve per footfall, none otherwise. The event says whose
## step it is (`character`) and its gait (`running`, `crouched`), which the AI hears by.
