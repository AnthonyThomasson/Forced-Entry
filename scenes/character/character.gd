## Character domain: a generic top-down character. It owns the body, movement, aim-based "facing",
## the item inventory, and the knockback it takes from shoves. It reads its intent from a pluggable
## controller child (any node with a `control(character, delta)` method): the controller
## writes `move_input` / `aim_point` and calls `melee/shoot/select_slot`. Drawing
## is in character_visuals.gd, the hand/punch/fist geometry in character_hands.gd, the living
## motion of head, shoulders, hips and hands in character_pose.gd (stepped here each physics frame),
## the standing skeleton the limbs are drawn from in character_rig.gd, and the body's fall on death
## in character_ragdoll.gd (stepped here once dead).

## Emitted once when health drops to zero.
signal died
## Emitted when a blow lands on a body. `hand` is 0/1 for a melee punch, `KICK_HAND` for a leg kick,
## -1 for a shot; `damage` is the amount dealt (a punch scales it by its range of motion). Melee vs
## shot is told apart by `hand`, not by the damage value.

## through it (`penetrated` false: stopped or glanced off) deals only the armour's `blunt` share: no
## wound, no blood, its debris the armour's; one that got through deals all but the armour's
## `reduction`. A hit with no height (a frag's blast) strikes the whole body, cut by the torso
## armour's `blast`. A wound records the deformation relative to the shoulders (it dents the drawn
