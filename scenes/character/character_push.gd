## Character PUSH (Character domain): the one shove a character's walking body and its pressing legs
## give a pushable piece. The impulse lands at the point of contact, so the piece's own rigid-body
## torque turns it: a sofa pushed at one end slides and swings about a point near the far end, one
## pushed in the middle of a side just slides. The piece is carried rather than launched: the
## impulse is capped so the CONTACT POINT (the piece's linear velocity plus its spin about the
## centre) is never driven faster along the push than the pusher's pace x `push_carry_factor`. The
## cap is worked out with the piece's effective mass at that point (its mass and inertia together),
## so a turning end is held to the same pace as a sliding one. A piece with no `linear_velocity`
## (another character) takes the shove uncapped and ignores the point.


## Shove `piece` (a pushable: `apply_impulse(v, at)` + `get_mass()`) along unit `dir` with up to
## `impulse`, at world point `at_world`, carried at no more than `speed` (px/s, the pusher's pace
## along `dir`) x `push_carry_factor`.
