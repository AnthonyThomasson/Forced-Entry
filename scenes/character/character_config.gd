class_name CharacterConfig
## Tuning for a Character walking into / being shoved by world objects, being shot, being stunned,
## its pixel art, its body, hand stances and pose, and its fall on death (scenes/character/). A
## `class_name` holder of `static var`s — read as `CharacterConfig.<name>`; there is no instance and
## no autoload.
##
## Walking the character body into a pushable object (anything exposing `apply_impulse`
## — i.e. furniture, not walls) shoves it via the same impulse pipeline a projectile
## uses, divided by the object's mass. Pushing also slows the character (heavier =
## slower), and a fast object sliding into the character shoves them back.

# --- Postures (the body's height: stand or crouch; a controller picks one with `set_posture`) ---
## Not to be confused with `stances` below (how a hand is held). A posture trades speed for a
## smaller target: `speed` multiplies the walk speed; `turn` is the fastest the body swings round to
## the aim (rad/s, 0 = at once); `coverage` is the body's height on the same 0–100 scale as an
## object's coverage (a bullet carries one height, and strikes whatever is taller than it), so a
## lower posture is struck by fewer shots and hides behind lower cover; `height` scales the drawn
## body's standing heights. Keep `crouch` coverage at or below the AI's `cover_min` (40), so
## everything it treats as cover hides a crouch.

##   units) or `household`. police       a uniformed police unit (its rank marks, its livery's
##   marks) rather than a criminal's gear. weapons      the weapon styles (`Item.style`) a character
##   in it is armed with, one drawn per character. palettes     name -> colours, one drawn per
##   character and palette (a garment look's `palette`; a police unit's are single). bare
##   garment slot -> the palette of what is drawn where nothing is worn there (`body`, `pants`,
##                `feet`). skin, hair   the skin tones and hair colours drawn from; `hair_styles`
##                style -> weight (`short`, `long`, `buzz`, `bald`, `mohawk`).
##   glove        the gloves' colour, worn with chance `gloves` (else the fists are bare skin).
##   pack         the chance of a pack on the back (its colour the `pack` palette's), `pack_kind`
##   (`medic`: a cross on it). trim         the livery's mark colour (stripes, stencil, crosses);
##                `edge` its edge sheen (alpha 0 = none); `visor` a helmet's visor; `led` a status
##                lamp; `pad` the knee pads.
##   chrome       a chrome limb's colour; `chrome_arms` [chance of one, chance of both] arms in
##                chrome; `chrome_leg` the chance of a chrome shin.
##   optics       [[weight, eyes, face], ...]: the eyes (`glow`, `multi` lenses, "") and face
##                (`respirator`, `plate`, `goggles`, "") drawn together; `glows` the eyes' colours.
##   tattoo, inlays, headset, spine, cables, patchwork   chances of inked skin, black plates set in
##                the skin, a headset, a spine rig, cables over the shoulder, a sleeve patched in
##                another colour; `inks` the tattoo colours.
