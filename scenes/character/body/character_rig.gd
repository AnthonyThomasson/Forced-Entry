## Character RIG (Character domain, animate layer): the standing skeleton as 3D joints (local x/y
## over the floor plus height z), solved fresh from the live pose and the hands. Both the standing
## body's limbs (character_visuals.gd) and the ragdoll's starting pose (character_ragdoll.gd) are
## drawn from it, so a body falls from exactly the pose it was standing in.
## - The upper body (chest, head, shoulders) sits at the pose's torso frame and lunge; the hips and
##   feet at its hip frame, which stays planted while the shoulders twist over it.
## - Each arm is two-bone IK from its shoulder to where the hands layer holds the fist, at the
##   grip height of its stance, the elbow bent toward the stance's pole. A hand out of reach pulls
##   its shoulder after it (a punch's lean-in), up to CharacterConfig.body_shoulder_reach.
## - Each foot strides fore and aft, opposite to the arm on its side, lifting as it swings through;
##   the knee is IK bent forward.
## - A crouch lowers the hips to the character's eased posture height and pitches the spine forward
##   about the pelvis (the neck pitching on, so the head sits ahead of and above the shoulders); the
##   hips and feet come together, the feet standing a little ahead of the pelvis so the knees lead.
## - A stunned body hunches: the spine and the neck pitch forward by the pose's `hunch()` on top of
##   any crouch, its stride is shorter (`stun_stagger_stride`) and its pelvis sways with the pose's
##   `hip_sway`.
## - Each ankle rests where the legs layer (character_legs.gd) stopped it against a wall or piece of
##   furniture.
## Joints are read by index (the constants below, shared with the ragdoll) through `point(i)`, and
## each foot's direction through `toes(i)`. Index pairs are per hand side (0 = the character's right
## as drawn, 1 = the left). A rig also answers `torso()` and `face()`, so a crouched body is drawn
## like a fallen one. Tuning: CharacterConfig.body_*, CharacterConfig.stances,
## CharacterConfig.postures.
