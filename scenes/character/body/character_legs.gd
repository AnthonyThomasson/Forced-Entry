## Character LEGS (Character domain, animate layer): the legs' contact with the world. The rig
## strides, folds and trails the feet wherever the pose puts them, which can be well past the body's
## collision circle (a stride's toes, a crouch's leading knees), so this layer, stepped by
## character.gd each physics frame after the pose, finds where each leg would stop and keeps the
## drawn leg there:
## - each ankle is swept from the body centre toward where the rig would put it (a foot-sized
##   circle, like the hands, `body_sweep.gd`) and rests at the first wall or solid piece it meets,
##   sliding the leftover along the surface; the rig reads it back through
##   `character.anatomy.legs.ankle(i)`;
## - the knee is judged the same way from the leg the ankle leaves: a knee that would pass through
##   something moves the foot back by what it overshot (a crouch facing a wall keeps its knees off
##   it), up to `KNEE_TRIES`;
## - a foot or knee swinging into a light, pushable piece shoves it where it rests, scaled by how
##   fast the foot is moving into it and how far it wanted to go, and capped so the piece is never
##   driven faster than the character walks (the body's own push, `character_push.gd`). A fixed wall
##   only stops the leg, and a foot at rest pushes nothing.
## Other characters are solid to a leg (it rests against them) but are never shoved by it. Nothing
## is cast while nothing is near. Tuning: CharacterPushConfig.leg_*.
