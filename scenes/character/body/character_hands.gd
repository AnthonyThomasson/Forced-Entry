extends Node2D
## Character HANDS layer. Owns the hand geometry (collision-resolved so hands rest on
## walls/objects), the punch animation (a tween per swing) and the punch hit detection
## (a shape query at the fist's raw punch position). The character sets `facing` and calls
## `punch(hand)`; visuals read `hand_position()` / `hand_radius`. WHICH hand punches and WHEN
## is decided by the held Item + the controller — this layer only animates and detects the
## swing it is told to. The rest pose follows the character's pose (the stance the held item asks
## for, trailing the aim, swinging with the walk, kicked back by recoil).

## Emitted when the extended fist overlaps a body. `hand_index` is 0 (left) or 1 (right);
## `damage` is the range-of-motion-scaled punch damage dealt (0 at point-blank, up at full reach).
