## Character KICK (Character domain, animate layer): a leg kick, independent of the held item,
## always with the right leg (side `LEG`, as the hands' side 0). `start()` begins one, `update()`
## runs it each physics frame: the foot is thrown out along the facing (STRIKE), then drawn back
## (RECOVER); no new kick starts until it is done. The rig draws the foot at `amount()` of the way
## out (`character.anatomy.leg_kick_amount(i)`), and during the strike a shape query at the foot
## reports every body it reaches, once each per kick: it shoves a pushable (`apply_impulse`) and
## damages whatever takes damage (`take_damage`), then emits `kicked`. Like a punch it never deforms
## what it hits. Tuning: CharacterMeleeConfig.kick_*.

## A body was struck: the damage it was dealt (a kick is always full strength).
