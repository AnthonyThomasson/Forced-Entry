## Character POSE (Character domain, animate layer): the living motion layered over the aim. The
## head, each hand, a held weapon and the shoulders each chase `facing` on their own damped spring
## — the head first, a steady (aiming or supporting) hand next, the weapon a touch behind it, free
## hands each at a slightly different pace, the shoulders last — so a turn ripples through the body.
## The hips are planted while standing and turn to the walking direction while walking, so the feet
## stay put under a twisting upper body and step the way the body travels. Walking sways the
## shoulders and swings the free hands along a stride; the head leans into the movement and settles
## when it stops; standing still, it breathes and glances around. A kick (recoil) throws a hand back
## and twists the shoulders; a punch twists them toward the punching side and lunges the upper body.
## Each hand eases between the stances its item asks for (CharacterConfig.stances): where it rests,
## how high it is gripped, how its elbow bends. A stunned character (the level handed to `update`,
## eased) hunches (the rig reads `hunch()`) and staggers: shorter, uneven strides, the hips swaying
## over the planted foot and the head lolling (docs/grenades.md G13). Owned and stepped by
## character.gd each physics frame; read by the hands (their rest pose), the rig (the joints) and
## the visuals (each part's angle and offset). Visual only: aim, shots and punches stay on `facing`.
## Tuning: CharacterConfig.pose_*, stun_look_ease, stun_hunch_pitch and stun_stagger_*.

## A wavering hand (a stance's `waver`) also rises and falls, this many body radii per px of its
## wander across, this many seconds out of step with it.
