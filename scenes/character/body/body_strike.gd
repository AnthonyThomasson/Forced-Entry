## Character BODY sub-domain: the melee strike a punch (character_hands.gd) and a kick
## (character_kick.gd) share. A circle is queried at the striking point on the solid layer; each
## body in it not struck yet this swing is shoved through the pushable contract at the contact
## (`apply_impulse(impulse, at)`, so a piece struck off-centre turns), logged, reported to
## `on_hit(body, damage)` and dealt the damage (`take_damage`). A strike never deforms; a wall (no
## `apply_impulse`) takes the damage without moving. Stateless.

## Physics layer a strike meets: walls, solid furniture and living characters.
const MASK := PhysicsLayers.SOLID


## Strike every body the `blow`'s circle overlaps, but `character` itself and those already in
## `struck` (each one struck is added to it), shoving it by the blow's `impulse` and dealing it its
## `damage`. With `first_only` it stops after the first body.
