## Human input driver for a Character. Attach as a child of the character; each physics
## frame the character calls `control(character, delta)`, and this is the ONLY place in the
## character domain that reads Keybinds / the mouse. Swap in a different `control()`-having
## node (e.g. an AI brain) to drive a non-player character with no other changes.

## The fire button went down over a HUD control, so this press belongs to the UI until it is
## released.

## (the gun paces itself). A click on a HUD control (the overlay bar, a panel) belongs to the UI,

## over. A press that began on the UI stays the UI's however far it is dragged.
