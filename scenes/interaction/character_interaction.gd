## Character INTERACTION layer. Owns object interactions end to end: on a request it finds the
## reachable objects that advertise interactions (their `get_interactions()`), keeps only the
## actions whose item gate passes, targets the object nearest the mouse, and starts a random one
## of that object's valid actions — freezing the character in place until the next request ends
## it and returns the character to where it started. A `move_to` action additionally snaps the
## character onto the object and lets the two bodies overlap (a temporary collision exception, so
## sitting/lying puts the character ON the object without either ejecting or shoving the other);
## actions without `move_to` act in place. The character forwards `try_interact()` (the player's
## random toggle) plus `interactions_in_reach()` / `interact_with(object, id)` / `end_interaction()`
## (a controller picking a specific object + action), and reads `is_busy()` / `active_label()`;
## it never learns what an interaction means, so this system can be iterated on its own.
