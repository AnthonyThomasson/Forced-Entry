class_name ArrangementDefinitions
## Aggregator over the per-category catalogs in scenes/worldgen/categories/. Merges
## every catalog's ARRANGEMENTS and RECIPES into two cached lookups and exposes the
## lookups RoomFurnisher uses. Shared arrangements/recipes live in
## GeneralCatalog; each room category owns the rest. To add an arrangement, drop it
## in the matching catalog (or GeneralCatalog if used by 2+ categories) and list it
## in a recipe zone.
##
## Authoring conventions for an arrangement:
## An arrangement is authored in a local frame AS IF PLACED AGAINST THE TOP WALL:
##   x runs along the wall (0..footprint.x), y is depth into the room (0..footprint.y).
## Item `pos` is the item's center. `rotated` swaps an item's width/height (90° turn).
## Item `facing` is the way its front faces in this frame (default Vector2.DOWN, into the
## room): a sofa facing a TV on the top wall is UP; a chair facing a table to its right is RIGHT.
## The furnisher rotates the whole frame onto whichever wall it picks, and may mirror it.
##   placement:     "wall" (backed against a wall) or "center" (free-standing).
##   prefer_corner: try the ends of a wall first.
##   tags:          an arrangement is skipped if a room already placed one with a
##                  shared tag (e.g. only one "fridge" per kitchen).
##
##   ground:        a non-solid piece that lies under the furniture (a rug, runner, mat): it never
##                  blocks the floor, avoids only other ground pieces, and is placed dead center
##                  first.
##
## A recipe's `zones` are filled in order. Each zone picks `count` (min..max) distinct
## arrangements from `options`; `required` zones warn if nothing could be placed. A recipe may
## also carry `fill: { target, options }`: once the zones are placed it keeps adding random
## `options` until solid footprints cover `target` (a fraction of the interior), bounded and scaled
## by WorldGenConfig. One palette is picked per room and applied to every "wood"/"fabric" object.
