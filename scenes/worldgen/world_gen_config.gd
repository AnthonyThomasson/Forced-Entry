class_name WorldGenConfig
## Tuning for house furnishing (scenes/worldgen/room_furnisher.gd), the run-down dressing, the
## street and its lamps. A `class_name` holder of `static var`s — read as `WorldGenConfig.<name>`;
## there is no instance and no autoload.

## After a room's required zones are placed, its recipe's optional `fill` ({ target, options })
## keeps adding arrangements until the room's solid footprints cover `target` (a fraction of the
## interior area), so big rooms are not left mostly bare. These knobs scale or cap that pass; the
## walkability checks that guard every placement are not tunable here.

## Master switch for the fill pass: off = rooms get only their recipe's zones.
static var fill_enabled: bool = true
## Multiplies every recipe's fill `target` (1 = as authored, 0 = no fill, 2 = twice as full).

## Placement tries the fill pass makes per room, hits and misses alike (each listed option is tried
## once, so this only caps a very long option list).
static var fill_attempts: int = 24
## Most pieces the fill pass adds to one room.
static var fill_max_pieces: int = 14
## The run-down dressing (room_dresser.gd), each room on RNGs of its own. Where things gather: a
## corner or a wall's foot `dress_reach` px in from the room's walls (`dress_inset` px off a wall's
## face), or `dress_furniture_gap` px beside a solid piece; whatever is placed lies within
## `dress_near` px of a wall line or a solid piece, clear of `dress_jamb` px round a doorway;
## `dress_tries` spots are tried for each.

## The street lamps along the front sidewalk (HouseSpawner): one about every `streetlight_every` px
## along it, each up to `streetlight_jitter` px either way off its even spot, its post
## `streetlight_curb` px in from the curb and its arm out over the road; every other one is a neon
## sign. No part of a lamp (its post or its overhang) comes within `streetlight_door_clear` px of a
## front or exit doorway's centre, nor into the strip straight out of one (the doorway's width plus
## `streetlight_door_strip_margin` px each side, `streetlight_door_strip_reach` px out from the
## wall): a lamp that would is dropped, not moved.
