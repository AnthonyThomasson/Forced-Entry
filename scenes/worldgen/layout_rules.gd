class_name LayoutRules
## World Generation domain: what makes a floorplan logical, as tunable data plus a pure validator. A
## `class_name` holder of constants and statics — read as `LayoutRules.<name>`; no instance, no
## autoload.
##
## A layout is a set of rooms (`{ key, type, rect }`) joined by doorways
## (`{ pos, width, front, rooms }`, `rooms` = the keys of the rooms the doorway touches: one for an
## exterior door, two for an interior one). The rules:
##   ROOMS  per room TYPE: `front` (may carry the front door), `exit` (may carry a secondary
##          exterior door), `through` (may be the only route between two other rooms; a
##          `through: false` room may still gate a private dead end such as an en-suite bathroom),
##          `max_doors` (most interior doors).
##   LINKS  which pairs of room types may share an interior door (symmetric).
## A type with no ROOMS entry gets DEFAULT_RULE; a type in no LINKS pair cannot share a door with
## anything, so a new room type has to be given its rules here before a plan can use it.
##
## `check` returns one readable string per violation (empty = a logical layout). HouseSpawner warns
## with them while building; tests/worldgen asserts every floorplan has none.

## The graph node standing for "outside the house" (a room with an exterior door is joined to it).

## `front` rooms are where a visitor first steps in (a security vestibule among them); `exit` rooms
## may carry a back/side/garage door. Bedrooms, bathrooms, offices and a netrunner den are never
## walked through to reach something else (an en-suite dead end hanging off them is fine); a
## bathroom and a netrunner den are always dead ends with one door; a ripperdoc (chop shop) is
## walked through; a kitchenette has at most two doors.
