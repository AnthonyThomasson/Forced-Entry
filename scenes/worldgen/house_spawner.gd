## World Generation domain: builds a house from a HouseDefinitions floorplan: walls per room (via
## the Objects domain's WallFactory, in the GeneralCatalog.WALL style, with every doorway opening
## cut into each wall it lies on), furniture per room (via RoomFurnisher), its clutter and neon
## (RoomDresser) and each room's floor (via FloorFactory, the one its furnishing palette names);
## then, once every room stands, each room's wear (RoomDresser, through WearFactory), the street
## ring round the house (FloorFactory) and the street lamps along its front (ObjectFactory), clear
## of its doorways. The house is positioned so its front entrance lands on a point. A plan may also
## carry `exit` openings (a back/side/garage door).
