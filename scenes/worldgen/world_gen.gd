class_name WorldGen
## The World Generation domain's single entry point. Given a seed, an optional forced
## floorplan, and where the front entrance should land, it picks a plan, seeds one RNG for the
## whole run (the plan pick is its first draw, so a seed reproduces everything), and builds
## the house via HouseSpawner. Callers (Main) never touch HouseDefinitions/HouseSpawner
## directly — `generate`, `get_rooms`, `get_openings`, `bounds`, `annotate_layout`, the read-only
## catalogue lookups and the test reads `get_wear`, `get_clutter`, `get_street` and
## `get_streetlights` are the whole surface World-Gen exposes.


## Build a house and return its root Node2D (parented under `parent`). `rng_seed` of 0 picks a
## fresh random layout each run; `force_plan` ("" = random) pins a specific floorplan. Every
## doorway is an open archway; the house has one front entrance (on its south wall) and, in most
## floorplans, a back/side/garage exit.

## Describe a hand-laid layout `root` the way a generated house describes itself, so `get_rooms`,
## `get_openings` and the nav builder read it unchanged. `rooms` are `{ key, type, rect }` in WORLD

## lamp's centre in WORLD space, `node` the placed piece (a solid, anchored metal post, carved into
## the nav map, its arm and head overhead). None stands within the clearance of a front or exit
## doorway nor in the strip straight out of one. Empty for a null house or a hand-laid layout. (A
