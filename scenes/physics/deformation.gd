class_name Deformation
## Physics System: stateless damage-deformation geometry + rendering, shared by furniture, walls,
## characters and vehicles (their visuals and, for furniture/walls, collider rebuilds), so the drawn
## silhouette and any collider come from the same deformed polygon. The caller owns the
## impact list. Tuning lives in PhysicsDeformConfig and PhysicsDeformLookConfig (and, for a
## character, CharacterConfig).
##
## An "impact" is a Dictionary in the drawer's local space:
##   pos:    Vector2  contact point
##   inward: Vector2  unit direction INTO the surface (dents push points this way)
##   depth:  float    dent depth in px (from dealt damage)
##   chunk:  bool     true = carve a jagged missing piece instead of a shallow dent
##   seed:   int      stable RNG seed so a hit's jitter/cracks don't shimmer each frame
##   blood:  float    0..1 blood the striker carried onto the surface (drawn with the hole)
## `new_impact` builds one and `push_impact` adds it to a list, so every caller records the same
## schema.

## Sentinel for an unset color argument: callers pass it to accept the default derived from
## the shape's own colors (an intentional mark color always has non-zero alpha).
