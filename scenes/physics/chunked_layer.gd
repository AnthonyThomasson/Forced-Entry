## Physics System: the shared base of the batched decal layers (`DebrisLayer`, `ScorchDecals`,
## `BloodDecals`): one node under a world node holding every mark as plain data, drawn by a few
## chunk nodes instead of one node each. Marks are grouped in `CHUNK`-px squares and only the chunk
## that gained or lost one redraws; past a layer's cap the oldest is dropped (and flagged `dead`). A
## layer supplies its marks' recipe, its cap and its chunk node (`_make_chunk`), whose `_draw` reads
## `marks_in` its cell.
