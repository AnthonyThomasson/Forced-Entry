class_name Physics
## Physics System entry points, stateless `static` helpers: `impact_impulse` and `spawn_debris`,
## which the hittables' `take_hit()` call to turn a HitInfo into a shove and a burst of debris
## (furniture, a character and a vehicle; a wall only throws debris); `bleed_out`, a dead
## character's pool; and `spawn_explosion`, the look of a grenade's burst (the Projectile System's
## `Explosion`). Physics knows nothing of the Projectile, Objects, Character, Vehicles or World-Gen
## domains: it takes a HitInfo + a plain surface Dictionary and returns/acts on generic nodes, so it
## stays a leaf domain other systems depend on but it never depends back.


## Impulse a hit imparts to the struck object, before the object's own mass divides it
## (that happens in Knockback.apply_impulse). Follows the striker's travel direction,
## scaled by its speed factor and by whether it penetrated (a pass-through dumps less
## momentum than a ricochet/embed). Tuned by PhysicsImpactConfig.
static func impact_impulse(hit: HitInfo) -> Vector2:
	var force_scale := (PhysicsImpactConfig.penetration_scale
			if hit.penetrated
			else PhysicsImpactConfig.no_penetration_scale)
	return hit.direction * PhysicsImpactConfig.impulse * hit.speed_factor * force_scale


## Show a hit: a particle burst at the entry point (weak, with a much stronger one at the exit when
## the striker passed through, `hit.has_exit`; a hit that stays in the object gets one full-strength
## burst) plus chips knocked off the entry, all styled by the struck object's `get_surface()`
## (`color`, `material`) and added under `parent` (placed by world position, so `parent` may be
## offset from the origin). Entry particles and chips fly out along the surface normal, or back
## along the shot when the normal is degenerate; the exit burst follows the shot. A hit that carries
## blood (`hit.blood > 0`, a bullet that just left a character) also throws a few red droplets and
## chips from the entry. Particles need PhysicsConfig.hit_particles_enabled, chips
## PhysicsConfig.debris_enabled, and the blood bits BloodConfig.enabled.
static func spawn_debris(parent: Node, hit: HitInfo, surface: Dictionary) -> void:

	# Through the object: a weak burst going in, the strong one coming out. Otherwise one
	# full-strength burst.

	DebrisSpawner.spawn(hit.position, spray, parent, base_color, material)


## Start a dead body's bleed-out: one slow, flowing pool (BloodPoolConfig.bleed_out_*) spreading
## from where its blood leaves it — `source.blood_origin()` if it has one (where it lies), else its
## position — added under `parent`. `exclude` is the body's RID(s). Returns the pool (null while
## BloodConfig.enabled is off).
static func bleed_out(parent: Node, source: Node2D, exclude: Array) -> Node:
	if not BloodConfig.enabled:
		return null
	return BloodSpawner.bleed(parent, source, exclude)


## Show a grenade's burst of `kind` (`&"frag"` or `&"stun"`) at world point `at` under `world`: a
## bright flash, for a frag a fireball puff and, with smoke drifting off, a scorch left on the floor
## under it; a stun is a white flash and thin smoke. Looks and timings are
## `PhysicsExplosionConfig.looks`; spawns nothing while `PhysicsExplosionConfig.fx_enabled` is
## off.
static func spawn_explosion(world: Node, at: Vector2, kind: StringName) -> void:
	if PhysicsExplosionConfig.fx_enabled:
		ExplosionFx.spawn(world, at, kind)
