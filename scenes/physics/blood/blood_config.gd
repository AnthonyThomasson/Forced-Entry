class_name BloodConfig
## Tuning for the blood system (scenes/physics/blood/). A `class_name` holder of `static var`s —
## read as `BloodConfig.<name>`; there is no instance and no autoload.
##
## Blood is its own physical reaction, kept separate from the debris and deformation knobs in
## PhysicsConfig and PhysicsDeformConfig. A wounded body (BloodWound) throws a quick spray of
## splatters when it is hit, then keeps dripping: one drop every
## `drip_interval_min`..`drip_interval_max` seconds while the wound lasts, each landing as a
## BloodSplat. A dead body also bleeds out one slow, wide pool (`bleed_out_*`) from where it came to
## rest.

## Master switch for blood: off = hits leave no splatter or drips and dead bodies no bleed-out
## (BloodWound.record / Physics.bleed_out spawn nothing).

## --- Death bleed-out ---

## Floor texture steering a bleed-out flow (BloodSurface): off = the floor is ignored. Flow-cost

## --- Footprints and smears (BloodField, BloodDecals, BloodFootprints, BloodSmear) ---

## Smears: an object drags blood as feathered ribbons, one per "finger" across its footprint. Finger
## spacing (px) and the most fingers; the speed (px/s) below which an object smears nothing; the

## Blood pulled out of a pool extends the pool's own outline: a finger carrying at least
## `smear_trail_min` load within `smear_trail_reach` px of a pool grows it by that load x
