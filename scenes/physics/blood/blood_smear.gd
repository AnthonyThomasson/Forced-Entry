class_name BloodSmear
extends Node
## Physics System, blood: smears blood along the floor for a RigidBody2D that slides through it (a
## Node child of the body, composed like Knockback). The owner gives the body's footprint
## (`set_footprint`, a polygon in the body's local space); across it sits a grid of "fingers", fixed
## to the body so they turn with it. While the body moves, each finger soaks up wet blood
## (BloodField) under it and, every `smear_segment_length` px, extends a ribbon (BloodDecals) behind
## it. A ribbon is wider than the finger spacing so neighbours merge into one smudge, wanders
## sideways on smooth noise, thins with the finger's load (`smear_decay_per_px`), tapers to a point
## where it ends and, once the load is low, breaks into dry-brush dashes. Over blood already on the
## floor a ribbon is see-through and it eases in along its first px, so the smear flows out of a
## puddle with no edge. Nothing is laid with BloodConfig.smear_enabled off.

## A finger's decay, width and pickup vary by up to this fraction, so streaks end and thicken
## unevenly.
const VARIATION := 0.5
## Distance (px) over which a new ribbon's sideways wander eases in from the finger's own line.

## Fingers: { local (Vector2), soak (0..1), prev (world Vector2, or null at rest), ribbon (open
## mark, or null), run (px laid on this ribbon), travelled (px moved), alpha (last sample's), decay,
## gain, width, phase }.
