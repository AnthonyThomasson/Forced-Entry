class_name ScorchDecals
extends "res://scenes/physics/chunked_layer.gd"
## Physics System: a layer of scorch marks (the black burn a frag leaves on the floor) under a world
## node, batching every mark so a floor full of them costs a few draw calls and no nodes of their
## own (`chunked_layer.gd`, as `DebrisLayer` and `BloodDecals`). A mark is stepped rows of
## `PhysicsExplosionConfig.pixel` px, ragged at the edge, a darker core inside a lighter rim, with
## a few specks flung out round it. Marks are grouped in `CHUNK`-px squares and only the chunk that
## gained or lost one redraws. The oldest are dropped past `Despawner.max_scene_objects`, the same
## bound every other kept mark answers to. Drawn at the blood decals' depth, under the furniture and
## the living.

## The rim is this share of the core's alpha, and the core this share of the mark's radius.
