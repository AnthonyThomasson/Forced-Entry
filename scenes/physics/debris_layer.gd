extends "res://scenes/physics/chunked_layer.gd"
## Physics System: the chips that have come to rest, drawn as one layer under a world node instead
## of one node each. A chip (`debris.gd`) is a node only while it flies; as it lands it hands its
## place, turn, colour, size and shape here and frees itself, so a floor strewn with a thousand
## chips costs a few draw calls and no nodes. Chips are grouped in `CHUNK`-px squares and only the
## chunk that gained or lost one redraws (`chunked_layer.gd`). The oldest are dropped past
## `Despawner.max_scene_objects`, the same bound the flying chips are tracked against, so the floor
## never accumulates chips without end. A layer draws under whatever is added to its node after it,
## as `BloodDecals` does.
