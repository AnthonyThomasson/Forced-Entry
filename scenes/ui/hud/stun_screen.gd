extends CanvasLayer
## UI domain: the stunned player's screen (G14 of `docs/grenades.md`). At the burst of a flash the
## screen goes white and fades back over the blind time, through a frozen afterimage of the frame at
## the moment of the flash: the afterimage holds solid while the white is strong, then gives way to
## the live view as the white thins. A bang that only deafens whitens nothing, and the screen
## watches the one character it is given, so someone else's flash changes nothing.
##
## A decoupled observer like the other HUDs: `watch(character)` then it reads the character's
## `stun_view()` (`{ blind, blind_total, deaf, level }`) and listens to the `&"stun"` events for the
## moment a flash lands (to take the afterimage). `drawn()` is what is shown:
## `{ white, afterimage, remaining }` (what the test reads). Main builds it for the human.

## The layer it draws on, over the HUD (the whole point is that it hides everything).
const LAYER := 90
## The white's colour, a touch warm like a real flash.
const WHITE := Color(1.0, 0.99, 0.95)
## A new flash takes a fresh afterimage only when the white of the last one has thinned below this
## (otherwise the frame it would capture is itself mostly white).
