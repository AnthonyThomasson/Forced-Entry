## UI domain: the order markers (`docs/leadership.md` LD12, D5), what the human leader sees of its squad: each living member's order
## target (a line from the member to the doorway it stacks on or ambushes, or the room it defends, the target ringed and named, with the member's
## latest progress), and a ring round each teammate selected in the command menu. Who leads is the squad-leaders debug overlay's
## (`ui/overlays/leader_overlay.gd`). Main builds it only when the human leads, under the match's `World` node (world space), drawn at
## `DrawLayers.ABOVE` (interface 11) so a character never hides its marker.
##
## A decoupled observer like the stack markers: `watch(view)` takes the squad's `view()` callable (`{ leader, members: [{ node, order,
## step }] }`, an order carrying its target point `pos`), polled each frame; `set_selection(nodes)` is the command menu's selection. It
## reads the members through the Character API only (`global_position`, `is_dead`). An order that is done is no longer drawn; one the
## member refused is drawn in red. `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`: the selection changes while the menu holds the tree paused.
