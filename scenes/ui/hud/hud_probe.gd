## UI hud: how the hud observers find an NPC's controller, used by the spectator inspector: the
## child in the group `npc_controllers` (the AI controller, interface 7), which `debug_zones()` and
## `known_contacts_for_display()` are read off.


## The AI controller child of `character` (in the group `npc_controllers`), or null (also for the
## player, a null or a freed character).
