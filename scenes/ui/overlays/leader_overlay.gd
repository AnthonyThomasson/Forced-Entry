## UI domain: the squad-leaders debug overlay (`docs/leadership.md` LD12), a global toggle of the
## overlay bar (`OverlayRegistry.LEADERS`, `show_leaders`, off by default). A crown over each side's
## leader, in any match (a played one or Watch / Endless), so who leads, and who leads next once a
## leader falls, can be seen. Main builds one under the match's `World` node (world space), drawn at
## `DrawLayers.ABOVE` (interface 11) so a character never hides its crown.
##
## A decoupled observer like the order markers: `watch(views)` takes the squads' `view()` callables
## (`{ leader, members }`, interface 21), polled each frame while shown; it reads the leader through
## the Character API only (`global_position`, `is_dead`). `PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`: the crown stays on
## the leader while the match is paused.
