extends "res://scenes/ai/debug/debug_overlay.gd"
## AI domain: an optional debug overlay for the NPC's tactical geometry, in two independent aspects.
## The point ZONES (`show_tactics`) are every candidate position its perception laid out for the
## last decision (fire spots, flank sides, ways to advance or retreat, leads, rooms to search,
## objects), each a coloured marker tagged by kind. The ROOM zones (`show_room_zones`) are every
## room of the house drawn as a rectangle tinted by how the NPC regards it now (the room it is in,
## searched, unsearched, or not yet seen) — the room reasoning the search / room / flank points are
## placed against. It reads the sibling GoalController's `debug_zones()` / `debug_room_zones()`
## through its public API, senses nothing and feeds nothing back (the "draw on its own child Node2D"
## convention, like vision_debug.gd).

## Marker colour per zone category (the categories `debug_zones()` tags each point with). A colour
## is drawn once as an in-world label beside its first marker, so the palette reads as a legend.
const ZONE_COLORS := {
	&"fire": Color(1.0, 0.3, 0.2),       # red — a spot to shoot the hostile from
	&"flank": Color(1.0, 0.6, 0.1),      # orange — a side to take around it
	&"advance": Color(1.0, 0.9, 0.2),    # yellow — a point part-way in, closing on it
	&"retreat": Color(0.3, 0.6, 1.0),    # blue — somewhere to fall back to
	&"lead": Color(0.8, 0.4, 1.0),       # purple — an investigation lead (last seen / gunfire)
	&"search": Color(0.5, 0.9, 0.5),     # green — a room or unexplored area to search
	&"entry": Color(0.2, 0.9, 0.9),      # cyan — a stack slot beside a doorway to enter a room by
	&"room": Color(0.4, 0.8, 0.8),       # teal — a known room to go to
	&"interaction": Color(0.9, 0.9, 0.9), # white — an object to use
	# magenta — a non-room go-to (starting post / entrance)
	&"waypoint": Color(0.9, 0.3, 0.8),
	# olive — where a grenade would burst (thrown from the NPC's spot or a throw spot)
	&"grenade": Color(0.75, 0.75, 0.3),
}
## Outline / tint colour per room status (how the NPC regards each room), from `debug_room_zones()`.
const ROOM_COLORS := {
	&"current": Color(1.0, 0.85, 0.2),   # gold — the room the NPC is standing in
	&"searched": Color(0.4, 0.8, 0.5),   # green — seen and searched recently
	&"unsearched": Color(0.95, 0.5, 0.2), # orange — seen but not searched (a place to search)
	&"unknown": Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.6),    # grey — not yet seen at all
