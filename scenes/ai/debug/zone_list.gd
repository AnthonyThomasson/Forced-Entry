## AI DEBUG sub-domain — ZONE LIST. Flattens the option groups of a decision snapshot into the
## tactical navigation ZONES the tactics overlay draws: every candidate position the perception
## weighed, as a world point with its `label` + `desc` and the kind of zone it is. A pure transform
## of data the orchestrator retains from the last snapshot; it touches no node.

## Non-room go-to options the room/search groups carry: the NPC's starting post and the front
## entrance. They aren't rooms (and an outside NPC's often sit well outside one), so the overlay
## tags them `waypoint` instead of `room`/`search` rather than letting them read as rooms.
const WAYPOINT_IDS := ["post", "entrance"]


## The tactical navigation ZONES in a snapshot's `options` — every candidate position the NPC's
## perception laid out for its last decision, flattened to world points (each with its `label`,
## `desc` and `tags`) tagged by the kind of zone each is (`fire` / `flank` / `advance` / `retreat` /
## `lead` / `search` / `entry` (the stack slot beside a doorway to enter by) / `room` /
## `interaction` / `grenade` (where a grenade would burst, every throw weighed, dropped ones
## included, with `from`: where it would be thrown from, the NPC's own spot or a throw spot), plus
## `waypoint` for the non-room go-to points — your starting post, the front entrance — which the
## room/search groups carry but which aren't rooms and often sit outside one).
## Empty until the first decision. Options with no world location (a point-blank punch, the hostile
## picks) are skipped.

## Append each option in `group` that has a world location to `out`, tagged `category` — except the
## non-room waypoints (WAYPOINT_IDS), re-tagged `waypoint`. Each entry also carries the option's
## `label` and `desc` (the human text Von reads, which spells out the deciding facts: cover, route,
## range) so an inspector can expose a clicked point's details, and a throw's `from`. The location
## is the option's `point` param, or an interactable's current position. Options with neither (a
## punch, a hostile bind) are skipped.
