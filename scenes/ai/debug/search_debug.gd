extends "res://scenes/ai/debug/debug_overlay.gd"
## AI domain: an optional debug overlay for how an NPC is searching a room — the line-of-sight
## COVERAGE a `look_around` search move performs. It reads the sibling GoalController's
## `debug_search_coverage()` (all the room's sample points, which are still unseen, the one being
## looked at now and the seconds left in the search's time budget) and draws, while the NPC is
## covering a room: every sample point dim, the still-UNSEEN ones bright, a line + ring to the
## current target, and a "seen / total" readout with the seconds left. So you can watch the NPC turn
## and relocate until the whole room has been seen, or the budget run out on it. Senses nothing,
## feeds nothing back (the "draw on its own child Node2D" convention, like tactics_debug.gd /
## vision_debug.gd).

const SEEN_COLOR := Color(0.4, 0.8, 0.5, 0.35)   # dim green — a sampled point already seen
const UNSEEN_COLOR := Color(1.0, 0.85, 0.2)      # bright gold — still to be seen
const TARGET_COLOR := Color(1.0, 0.4, 0.2)       # red — the point being looked at / walked to now
const POINT_RADIUS := 2.5
