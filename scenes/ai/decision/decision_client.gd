## AI DECISION sub-domain: the external-model transport. This wraps one round-trip to the local Von
## ("System One") decision server: it POSTs a state text plus ONE `choice` question over a set of
## option ids → descriptions, and resolves Von's answer into the top-ranked offered id. Von is a
## stateless single-shot ranker that scores each question independently, so the decision planner
## (decision_planner.gd) drives a multi-level walk by calling `ask()` once per level. It emits
## `answered(pick, probabilities)` on success and `failed()` on any error (request couldn't start,
## server unreachable or refusing, malformed response). It holds NO policy and never interprets ids.

## Von's top-ranked offered id for the question, plus its probability for every offered id.
