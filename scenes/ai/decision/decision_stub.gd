extends RefCounted
## AI DECISION sub-domain: a scripted stand-in for the Von server, used by game tests. While
## `active`, decision_client.gd answers every `ask()` from here instead of making an HTTP request,
## so the perception → decision → behaviour wiring can be tested deterministically without a server.
## It decides nothing about quality — it only returns the picks a test scripted.
##
## `rules` is an ordered list of `{ pick: String, question: String (optional) }`: the first rule
## whose `pick` is among the offered option ids (and whose `question` text, when given, occurs in
## the level's question) wins; with no matching rule the first offered id is taken. `fail` makes
## every ask fail, as if the server were down. `requests` logs each ask as
## `{ state, question, options: Array, pick }`.

## Answer from this stub instead of the server.
static var active := false
## Fail every ask (the server-down path).

static var rules: Array = []

## Physics frames an answer is held back, like a slow server (0 = the next frame). The old leaf
## keeps running meanwhile.
static var latency_frames := 0


## The id to answer `options` (id → description) with, or "" when `fail` is set. Logs the request.
