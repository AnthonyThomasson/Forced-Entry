class_name DecisionBudget
extends RefCounted
## AI DECISION sub-domain: how many decision snapshots may start in one physics frame, shared by
## every NPC. Building a snapshot (the perception's `sense()`) is the costliest thing an NPC does in
## one frame, and NPCs that spawned or came under fire together want to decide on the same frame;
## the controller asks here before it starts one. A refused NPC keeps its wish and asks again next
## frame, so one waits at most a frame per NPC ahead of it. The limit is a count, not a time, so
## when each NPC decides never depends on the machine's speed: a test sees the same frames every
## run, and two NPCs that would claim the same flank side on one frame decide on different ones,
## each hearing the other's radio first (`tests/ai/decision/decisions_spread_over_frames_test.gd`).

## Snapshots that may start in one physics frame. One flattens the cost into a single snapshot a
## frame; a test raises it to see every NPC decide at once.

## Whether a snapshot may start now: while fewer than `per_frame` have started this physics frame. A
## true answer counts as one started.
