## AI domain: development convenience that starts a local decision-model server (Von's `von serve`)
## when the game runs from the Godot editor, and stops it when the game exits. Exported builds never
## launch it. A server already answering on `port` is reused and left running, and only a server
## this launcher itself started is stopped on exit. Reuse is decided by probing `port` up to
## `probe_attempts` times so a slow-to-answer existing server is reused rather than racing into a
## duplicate that cannot bind the port. The server's output is appended to `user://von_server.log`
## and, when `echo_to_output` is set, printed to the editor Output panel as `[von] …` lines.
##
## The probe asks the server to DECIDE (see `health_path`), not merely to answer `GET /`, because an
## ORPHANED server is worse than an absent one. A `von serve` left behind by a hard-killed run
## (which skips `_exit_tree`) has a dead stdout pipe, so when it tries to fetch weights the progress
## output raises `EPIPE` and the load fails — permanently. It still serves HTTP, so a liveness check
## would reuse it forever while every decision 422s. Asking for a real decision catches that and
## resolves `false` with the server's own explanation. To clear such a server by hand:
## `pkill -f "von serve"`.

## Emitted exactly ONCE when the server question settles: `live` is true when a server answered (NPC
## decisions will succeed), false when none is coming — no `von_path`, a failed spawn, an exported
## build, or `ready_timeout` elapsed. Main gates the match start on this, so every terminal path
## must reach `_resolve()`: one that silently never resolved would hang the setup window forever.
