## AI DECISION sub-domain: the DECISION TREE Von walks, as plain data. Von picks one option per
## level, top-down: a broad MODE (combat / investigate / search / idle), then within it a TACTIC,
## then a concrete OPTION (a place to move to, a position to fight from, an object to use) that ends
## in one behaviour PRIMITIVE. The planner (decision_planner.gd) walks it, one Von `choice` request
## per level; this file only describes the shape and the words Von reads. Per NPC, the controller
## can disable nodes, merge per-node overrides, and pick the entry node by situation (e.g. under
## fire → combat).
##
## Node fields (all optional except where noted):
##   label     — short tag shown in the path ("COMBAT"); also prefixes the HUD status.
##   desc      — the option text Von ranks when this node is offered at its parent's level. Von is a
##               CLASSIFIER: it picks the option whose text best matches the state, so a desc states
##               the SITUATION in which this option is right, in the same phrases perception writes
##               into the state ("You are badly wounded and being hit"), never an action label, and
##               no negated attributes (an encoder reads "no cover" as "cover"). The wording is
##               measured, not guessed: tools/von_probe.py checks it against clear-cut scenarios.
##               Template fields: {target} (the bound target's name), {blinded} (the bound target's
##               "X is blinded by a flash and cannot see you, or " when it is, else nothing), {gun}
##               (what the NPC calls its gun: "pistol", "assault rifle"), {summary} (the summary of
##               the node's `summary` option group, else its first `options` group — specifics
##               written by perception, kept in parentheses after the situation) and {situation}
##               (that group's `situation`: for a node offered in more than one case, the case at
##               hand in the state's own phrase, e.g. GRENADE's "Your line to X is blocked").
##   question  — the instruction Von answers when choosing AMONG this node's children/options. It
##               names the trade-off, since Von scores options against it. Same template fields as
##               desc.
##   context   — which perception state sections Von sees at this level (the goal is always shown).
##   children  — static child node ids, offered when their `requires` hold and their subtree has a
##   leaf. options   — option-group names (perception generators); each option becomes a leaf. A
##               group is looked up under the bound target first, then globally.
##   summary   — option-group whose summary fills {summary} (defaults to the first `options` group);
##               inside a confined subtree a group's `summary_inside` is used when it has one.
##   bind      — before its children, pick one option of group `bind_options` and bind it (e.g.
##               which hostile to fight); `bind_question` is asked, with `bind_context` sections
##               (the options already carry each candidate's details — repeating them in the state
##               blurs the match). Skipped when there is only one.
##   requires  — fact names that must be true ("!" negates); a binding name counts as a true fact.
##   confine   — this subtree is combat: a territorial NPC drops options outside the house, and a
##               member ordered to defend a room those outside that room.
##   ask       — Von is always asked about this node, and about the level that offers it: the
##               planner never takes it without asking, even as the lone option (INVESTIGATE:
##               whether a lead is worth going to is Von's call, read against the goal and where the
##               lead is).
##   drop_tags — options carrying any of these tags are never offered (e.g. a flank side an ally
##               already holds: Von can't weigh "taken by Invader2" — the name matches the state;
##               one whose route passes a known hostile; one with no shot at the target, one the
##               target is walking toward, or one whose point or route lies in an ally's line of
##               fire). A node whose options are all dropped is not offered at all.
##   primitive — the behaviour primitive a leaf runs (move / engage / melee / interact / hold /
##               reload / entry / throw / defend / follow); an option that names its own `primitive`
##               (ORDER's) runs that one. FLANK runs `engage` anchored at the chosen side: get
##               there, then fight from it. ADVANCE runs `move`: it only closes the distance, then
##               the NPC re-decides how to fight.
##   params    — default primitive params, merged under each option's own params. `run: true` lets
##               the behaviour sprint while travelling to the leaf's destination (Von never sees
##               it).
