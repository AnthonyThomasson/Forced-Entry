## AI BEHAVIOUR sub-domain — WATCH. Where an NPC looks when no primitive has a reason to look
## anywhere in particular, and which threat takes its eyes and its gun whatever it is doing
## (docs/gaze-and-fire.md). The rule is one sentence: an NPC is always either looking at (and, when
## it can, shooting) a threat, or watching its doors; never a wall, and never with its back to a
## known threat. Owns the pick of the threat and the rotating look at a room's doorways, and nothing
## else: `Behavior` runs the stage each tick and does the aiming, `Combat` the shooting,
## `Locomotion` the walk it looks down.

## Doorways nearer than this (px) are not worth watching: the NPC stands in them.
