## AI BEHAVIOUR sub-domain — COMBAT. Everything a fight does with the character's hands: taking a
## shot, throwing a punch, keeping an automatic gun's trigger down for a burst, stepping back when a
## barrel is against a wall, the reload reflex, and the peek-and-cover cycle (step out, shoot, duck)
## with its committed firing / cover spot, and throwing a grenade (`docs/grenades.md` G17: take it
## in hand, aim at the spot, throw, put the gun back). Owns the fire cooldown, that cycle's phase
## and timers and the throw's stage. `Behavior` decides WHICH fight is on (it holds the engaged
## contact and the hold-ground flag) and passes the target in each call; this class never chooses a
## target and reads the world only through the perception (`has_line_to`, `combat_spots`,
## `note_engaged`) and the character's public contract. It knows no gun from another: the gun it
## fights with is `Character.gun_slot()`.
