## AI BEHAVIOUR sub-domain. Runs the LEAF the decision planner chose — one behaviour PRIMITIVE with its
## params — as concrete movement and actions on the character, and holds the System-Two state Von (a
## stateless single-shot ranker) lacks: the engaged contact, the peek-and-cover combat cycle, the
## interaction in progress, and the COMMITMENT that keeps a choice running until it completes or a
## re-decision is due. The primitives:
##   move     — go to `point` (or until entering `arrive_room`), aiming along the way (`aim`: travel /
##              target / threat / point); a `look_around` search move covers the room by sight
##              (`search_coverage.gd`): it turns and relocates until it has seen all of it.
##   engage   — go to `point`, then fight `target_id` from there: `peek_cover` (step out, shoot, duck)
##              or `ambush` (hold the covered spot, fire the moment a line opens).
##   melee    — close on `target_id` and punch.
##   interact — walk to `object`, run its interaction `id`, hold it for `interaction_dwell`.
##   reload   — stand and swap in a fresh magazine (`Character.reload()`), then re-decide.
##   entry    — go through doorway `opening` into room `into` as a team member or alone: stack, slice the pie,
##              cross without stopping, take a corner, clear the room (`entry.gd`).
##   throw    — walk to the throw spot `from` when it has one (`walk`), take a grenade in hand, aim at `point`, throw it, radio it and
##              wait out the fuse with the gun back in hand
##              (`combat.gd`; the GRENADE tactic, `docs/grenades.md` G17).
##   defend   — the order to defend `room` (`docs/leadership.md` LD8): walk to the defend `spot`, then hold it with the gun on its
##              doorway `door_pos` (or, with none, turning among the room's doorways), as long as the order stands.
##   hold     — stay and watch.
## Outside the primitives, **the evade reflex** (`set_evade`, `docs/grenades.md` G16) takes over the NPC whatever it is doing, an
## entry included, while a live grenade threatens it: it runs to the safe spot the perception found, crouches there if it is
## behind cover, holds facing away until the burst, and re-decides.
## Whatever the primitive, a final WATCH stage (`watch.gd`, `docs/gaze-and-fire.md`) puts a threat in sight under the NPC's eyes and
## gun and, with none, makes it look down its path or at its doors. It never chooses WHAT to do — the planner does — and applies no
## policy beyond the params it is handed (`confine_inside` keeps a territorial NPC from chasing out of the house). It owns a
## `Locomotion` child for all pathing, a `Combat` module (shots, punches, bursts, the peek-and-cover cycle) and a
## `SearchCoverage` module, reads the world only through the PERCEPTION sub-domain (known
## contacts, combat geometry, engagement memory) and drives the character only through its public
## controller contract (`move_input` / `aim_point`, `select_slot`, `shoot`, `melee`, `interact_with`,
## `end_interaction`). All tunables are set by the controller before `setup()`.
