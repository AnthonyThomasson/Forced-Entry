## AI domain: the SIGHT sense for a goal-driven NPC. Pure, stateless geometry — "can this agent see
## that point right now?" — governed by tunable parameters (field of view, range, a close-range
## 360° awareness bubble, and line of sight). It holds NO policy: it never decides, remembers or
## picks. The perception runs each visible thing through it and deposits what is seen into the
## agent's memory (agent_memory.gd), so the "remember" half lives there; this is only the "see"
## half.
##
## A point is visible when it is (a) within `view_distance`, AND (b) either within
## `awareness_radius` of the agent — a near bubble you sense regardless of which way you face — or
## inside the forward cone of half-angle `fov_degrees / 2` around the agent's facing, AND (c)
## reachable by a clear straight line on the physics query layer. For SIGHT that line is forgiving:
## a standing agent looks OVER low furniture (a collider whose `coverage` is at or below
## `see_over_coverage` — tables, beds, islands, counters), so only walls and tall furniture
## (cabinets, wardrobes, fridges) break the line. Set `enabled` to false to make everything visible
## (omniscient), for debugging.
##
## This "look over low cover" rule is SIGHT-only: `blocked()` / `raycast()` below stay fully
## physical (every solid collider counts) because they serve line-of-fire and cover, where a bullet
## is still stopped by a table even though an agent can see across it.

## Physics layer walls + solid furniture live on (General's `PhysicsLayers.SOLID`, also used by
## CharacterInteraction). This module is the sub-domain's single owner of the solid-geometry ray
## query: the perception runs its line-of-fire and cover tests through `blocked()` / `raycast()`
## below rather than repeating it.

## The first hit that blocks SIGHT along `from`→`to`, or {} when the line reaches `to`. Unlike
## `blocked()` (physical: any solid collider stops it), this looks OVER low cover — it walks the
## line, skipping each collider whose coverage is at or below `see_over_coverage` and casting again
## past it, until it reaches `to` or hits something tall enough to block (a wall or tall furniture).
## A collider with no readable coverage is treated as a full blocker. The exclude list grows by one
## skipped collider each pass, so the walk always terminates (there are finitely many colliders on
## the line). Ignores `enabled`: it answers what the line is, the callers decide whether sight is
## gated.
