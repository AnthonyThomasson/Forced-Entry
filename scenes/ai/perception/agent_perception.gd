extends Node

## AI domain: perception/sensor for a goal-driven NPC. It has two halves. `observe()` is the SEE
## pass — run every tick, it tests what is currently visible (via the vision sense, agent_vision.gd),
## deposits sightings into the agent's memory (agent_memory.gd) — every other character
## (`saw_character`, with a smoothed movement track, its facing and raw hit-damage) and, for an NPC
## that must learn its surroundings, rooms and objects (`saw_room` / `saw_object`) — notes the rooms it
## has searched, and runs each character sighting through the hostility rules (agent_hostility.gd).
## `contacts()` is the resulting view: every character the agent knows of, hostile or not. `sense()`
## is the BUILD pass — run at the start of each decision, it gathers what the agent knows (contacts,
## callouts, learned house knowledge) and hands it to the SNAPSHOT AUTHOR (agent_snapshot.gd), which
## turns it into the SNAPSHOT the decision planner walks (facts / sections / option groups). The NPC
## knows only what it has perceived — sight, nearby hits, gunfire and footsteps within earshot, and its allies' radio
## callouts — and that knowledge decays as the memory does.
##
## This is the PERCEPTION sub-domain's public face: it OWNS the sight sense (agent_vision.gd), the
## hostility rules (agent_hostility.gd), the event memory (agent_memory.gd), the combat geometry
## (agent_tactics.gd), the doorway geometry (agent_entry.gd), the grenade geometry (agent_throw.gd), the live
## grenades known (agent_grenades.gd) and the snapshot author (agent_snapshot.gd) as internal modules, and surfaces
## knowledge only through its own methods. It holds NO policy: it never decides, gates by goal or
## picks — and the measured wording Von reads lives in the snapshot author, not here. The controller
## configures it (all tunables live on the GoalController, the single authoring surface) then calls
## `setup()` once.

## The internal modules this sub-domain owns (built in setup() from the config fields).
