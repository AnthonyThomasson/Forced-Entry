## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — GRENADES: the live grenades an NPC knows of, and the plan to get clear
## of the ones that threaten it (docs/grenades.md G15, G16). A grenade is known by **sight** (in the
## view cone with a clear line), by **hearing** it land (a `&"grenade"` bounce or rest within
## `hear_grenade`), by an ally's **callout** (`&"grenade"`, `&"frag_out"`, `&"bang_out"`) or because
## the NPC threw it (**own**). Each is `{ point, kind, fuse_left, fuse, radius, source }`
## (`known()`); it is forgotten when it goes off (`&"explosion"`) or is gone. Blind, the NPC sees no
## grenade it did not already know; deaf, the controller drops the events it would have heard (G15).
##
## The **evade plan** (`plan()`) is made for a known grenade the NPC is inside the danger zone of
## (`agent_throw.gd`): the nearest safe spot it can reach before the fuse runs out, replanned as the
## grenade moves (in flight, a bounce). It stands while the grenade lives, so the NPC holds its spot
## until the burst. `announcements()` hands the controller the grenade to radio once it has come
## down (a call names where it LANDED, which the plan of an ally that hears it needs). Holds no
## policy: the behaviour sub-domain carries the plan out.
