## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — SUSPICION. Why the NPC suspects a hostile is waiting in a room (`docs/grenades.md` G18): the facts
## behind a bang entry, read off the event memory, the lost hostiles and the allies' radio. A pure read; it holds no state and words
## nothing (the snapshot turns each reason into its phrase, `SnapshotOptions`; the behaviour's entry reads whether a new one has come
## up since it began, `docs/tactical-entry.md` E17). Owned by `agent_perception.gd`, shared with the snapshot author.
