## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — SNAPSHOT VOCABULARY. The shared words and tuning of the decision
## snapshot: the compass and flank-side names, the NPC's tuning (`NpcTuning`) its tunables are read
## from (ranges, bands, thresholds, caps), the house rooms of the decision being built, and the
## helpers that turn a distance, an age, a route, a bearing or a wound into the band Von reads.
## `agent_snapshot.gd` owns one (`vocab`); the sections and option modules read it, so every
## tunable is read through one place. Everything is worded for a classifier (see
## `agent_snapshot.gd`): bands not numbers, no negations.
