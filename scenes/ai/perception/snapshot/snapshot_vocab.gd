## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — SNAPSHOT VOCABULARY. The shared words and tuning of the decision
## snapshot: the compass and flank-side names, every tunable the perception sets from the
## controller's exports before a decision (ranges, bands, thresholds, caps), the house rooms of the
## decision being built, and the helpers that turn a distance, an age, a route, a bearing or a wound
## into the band Von reads. `agent_snapshot.gd` owns one (`vocab`); the sections and option modules
## read it, so no tunable is set twice. Everything is worded for a classifier (see
## `agent_snapshot.gd`): bands not numbers, no negations.

## Compass names for an 8-wind direction, indexed clockwise from east (screen +y is south).
const COMPASS := [
	"east", "south-east", "south", "south-west", "west", "north-west", "north", "north-east",

## How each flank side of a target is named to Von.
const SIDE_WORDS := {
	"left": "their left side", "right": "their right side", "rear": "behind them",
	"front": "their front",
