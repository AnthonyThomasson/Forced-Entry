## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — SNAPSHOT OPTIONS. Writes the option groups Von picks from: which
## hostile to fight, where to fire from, which flank side, how to close in or fall back, what to
## investigate, which room to search or explore and which furniture to use. Options are places and
## things, never verbs; each carries the facts that tell it from its siblings. A pure read of the
## event memory, the tactics geometry, the shared vocabulary and the knowledge handed in for the
## decision (`know`, set by `AgentSnapshot.build()`). `agent_snapshot.gd` calls it from `build()`.
