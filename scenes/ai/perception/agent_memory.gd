## AI domain: a generic, behaviour-agnostic memory for a non-player agent. It is an event log — an
## ordered list of remembered events, each a `topic` (what happened) with free-form `data` and a
## lifetime. Many events coexist, including many of the same topic; nothing is capped per topic.
## Ages and lifetimes run on the pausable game clock (`GameClock`), so a pause of the tree expires
## nothing. Behaviours (the controller) write events with `remember()` and read them back by topic
## to drive decisions; the perception renders fresh events into the decision state. It holds NO
## policy — it does not know what any topic means, beyond naming the reads of the two the whole
## perception asks about (`under_fire()` / `under_fire_from()`, `engaged()`).
##
## Cleanup is a configurable policy, not a per-topic limit: `capacity` caps the total stored.
## Eviction runs on every write: age-expired events are dropped first, then, if still over capacity,
## the oldest EXPIRABLE event (one with a positive ttl). Permanent events (ttl <= 0 — long-term
## facts like learned house knowledge) never age out and are never volume-evicted. So memory
## self-cleans its volatile events by age and by volume, both tunable per NPC, while keeping what it
## has learned.
##
## A write may name a `key` (the event's SUBJECT — a character id, a room key): it then supersedes
## the live event with the same topic + key instead of piling up beside it. Something re-observed
## every tick (a visible character) stays one entry per subject rather than flooding the log and
## volume- evicting every other expirable event. Unkeyed writes always append.
##
## The log is kept as one list per topic, each in the order its events were written, and every event
## carries its write order across topics (`seq`). A write or a read touches only the lists of the
## topic it names, not every event stored, and the order the log promises (newest first, oldest
## evicted first) is the `seq` order.

## Hard cap on total stored events; the oldest are evicted past it. <= 0 = unlimited.
var capacity: int = 128
## The stored events by topic, each list oldest first. An entry is
## `{ topic, key, data, at, ttl, seq }` (`at` in game msec, `GameClock.msec()`, `ttl` in s, `seq`
## the write order across all topics).

## expires.
var _earliest_expiry := INF


## Record that something happened: append an event under `topic` with `data`. `ttl` is its lifetime
## in seconds (<= 0 = permanent). A non-empty `key` supersedes any earlier event with the same topic
## + key (see the class note). Evicts expired/overflow events afterward.
