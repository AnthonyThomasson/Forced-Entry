## AI PERCEPTION sub-domain — TACTICS: the combat geometry an NPC reads off what it knows. Pure
## queries over known contacts, the physics space (via the vision sense's ray helpers) and the
## navigation map (Navigation interface 9): where it could flank a target from, which spots give a
## clear shot or cover, how to close in, where to fall back to — each candidate annotated with the
## facts a tactical choice turns on (clear shot, cover, route length and exposure, which ally already
## holds a side, which other hostile would see it, which hostile the route passes). It returns DATA
## only; the perception turns that into the words Von reads. It holds no policy and never decides.
## Firing spots are the one candidate set it screens: a spot whose route passes a known hostile, or
## where a hostile would catch the NPC in the open, is not a place to fight from at all.
##
## A target's FLANKS are measured in its own frame: its front is where it was last seen facing (when
## recent), else the side facing this NPC. Left/right are the target's own left/right.

## The flanking sides offered, as degrees off the target's front (screen space, +y down).
const SIDES := { "left": -90.0, "right": 90.0, "rear": 180.0 }

## (a stride, twice the walk's own arrival distance), and the unchanged situation would offer it again. No retreat nor walk toward the
## shots (LOCATE, the "where the shots came from" lead: `where_it_stands`) goes to one.
