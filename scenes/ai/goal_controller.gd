extends Node

## AI domain ORCHESTRATOR: a generic, goal-driven controller for a non-player character. It is the AI's own
## composition root (the `main.gd` of the AI domain): it wires the three sub-domains it builds (the fourth,
## debug/, reads its `debug_*` getters) and runs the SENSE → THINK → ACT loop, but holds almost no
## behaviour itself. It satisfies the character's controller contract (`control(character, delta)`) and
## writes only the intent the player controller writes (`move_input`/`aim_point`) plus the same public
## actions — all of that done by the behaviour sub-domain. It is the single authoring surface: every
## tunable below is an export here (so a defender or invader preset is all data on this one node), read
## straight from this node by the sub-domains it builds (their `apply_config(cfg)`) — and read again each
## decision, so a tunable retuned at runtime (a behaviour test, the dev command server) takes effect
## without a rebuild.
##
## The three sub-domains it builds (see their `domain-ai-<name>` skills; the fourth, DEBUG (debug/), is the
## draw-only overlays, children of the NPC that read this node's `debug_*` getters):
##   • PERCEPTION (perception/) — SENSE. What the NPC knows: sight, hostility, event memory, the
##     known-contacts view, combat geometry, and the decision SNAPSHOT (state sections, facts and
##     option groups). The NPC is NOT omniscient — it acts on last-KNOWN positions and forgets what decays.
##   • DECISION (decision/) — THINK. The decision TREE and its planner: Von picks top-down, one `choice`
##     request per level — a broad mode (combat / investigate / search / idle), the hostile, a tactic
##     (engage / flank / advance / retreat / reload …), then a concrete option — ending in one behaviour primitive.
##   • BEHAVIOUR (behavior/) — ACT. Runs the chosen primitive (move / engage / melee / interact / reload /
##     entry / throw / hold) as movement + actions, and holds the System-Two state Von lacks: the engaged
##     contact, peek-and-cover, the interaction in progress, and the commitment that keeps a choice running.
##
## This file keeps only the ORCHESTRATION: the control loop, the decide cadence, forcing a re-decision
## on a salient event or a finished task (interrupting a walk in flight when the situation now calls for
## a different starting point — e.g. under fire → straight to combat), the EventBus intake (hits, footfalls and
## allies' radio callouts) and posting this NPC's own callouts. The behaviour is pure DATA — `goal` plus
## the generic primitives and decision config exported below; a house defender and a house invader are
## the same code with different data.
