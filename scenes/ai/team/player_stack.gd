## AI domain · TEAM — the human's place in an AI stack (`docs/tactical-entry.md` E16). A child of the human's character
## (Main attaches it with `attach`, as it hands an NPC its `rooms` and `openings`): it listens to the same `&"callout"`
## radio the NPCs use, and when an allied team is stacking at a doorway near the human it reserves the human the first
## free slot there, on the team's side of the door or, when its way there would cross the doorway's view, on the side the
## human stands on (a split stack, E19), the way an NPC claims one: a `callout` with the human as speaker (`opening`, `into`, `slot`, `side`,
## `entry_step`, and `human`), repeated every `HEARTBEAT` s so the claim stays live. The AI's entry code reads it like any teammate's
## claim, so the point waits for the human at the ready barrier, a lone AI is no longer solo, and an AI behind the human
## crosses after it. The one thing it reads `human` for: no AI member moves up into the human's slot (E2).
##
## The human is never ordered: its radio step is read from where it stands (`claim` away from the slot, `ready` in it,
## `going_in` in the doorway, `in` through it). The claim is withdrawn (`abort`) when the human leaves (walks beyond
## `reserve_range * leave_factor`, dies), when no one is left stacking, or when the AI ahead is through and the human has
## not crossed within `go_timeout`; it is finished with `done` once through and nobody waits behind it.
##
## When the human leads its side's squad (`squad`, handed in as an NPC is handed its own: `MatchSpawner.bind_squad`), its claims say so
## (`leader: true`, `docs/leadership.md` LD17): a stack it ordered waits for it as for an ordered member, until it stands in its slot.
##
## `view()` is what the UI's stack markers draw. Observation and radio only: it never moves or steers the character.
