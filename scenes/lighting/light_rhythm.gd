## Lighting domain (private): how one light behaves over time, as a factor on its energy and on the
## brightness of the overlay that glows with it. Seeded per light (WorldLighting seeds it from the
## world's seed and the piece), so two lights of a kind are never in step, and the same world lit
## with the same seed flickers the same:
##   `steady`  always on (no rhythm is made for it);
##   `buzz`    on, with the small fast jitter of a tube or a cheap bulb;
##   `failing` a dying tube or bulb: on most of the time, then a burst of stutters, now and then
##   dark for a moment; `blink`   a sign: on and off in its own rhythm (a period, a share of it on,
##   sometimes a double blink); `shimmer` a screen: a restless flicker, and every few seconds a cut
##   to another picture (brighter or darker); `pulse`   a slow breathing (a heating coil, a
##   scanner's sweep, a status light).
