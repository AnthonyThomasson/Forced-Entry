class_name LightingConfig
## The Lighting domain's tuning (a `class_name` static holder, like the other domains' configs): the
## dusk, the room fixtures, the flashes, the per-floor light budget and the light textures
## (`docs/lighting.md`). What each piece's light is (where, what colour, how bright, which rhythms)
## is the piece's own declaration (Objects' `get_lights()`), not tuned here.

## Master switch (the Testing domain's `lighting.enabled`, which also turns General's
## `LightMasks.shadows` off, so no domain builds an occluder): off, `WorldLighting.light` builds
## nothing, and the world is drawn as its art alone.
static var enabled := true
# --- Dusk -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The ambient (one CanvasModulate over the world): a cool blue-violet, bright enough to read a room
## and the characters.
static var ambient_color := Color(0.40, 0.37, 0.55)
## The sky light on the street (none in the house: it has a roof): a dim orange-magenta, low in the
## south-west (the front of a house is south), from `sky_from`, unshadowed.
static var sky_color := Color(1.0, 0.5, 0.42)
static var sky_from := Vector2(-0.38, 1.0)
static var sky_energy := 0.42
# --- Room fixtures --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A room no piece lights (none of its lights is a kept `room_light`) gets a ceiling fixture at its
## centre: a bare bulb on its flex (drawn unshaded) and its light, overhead: shadowed by the walls
## only and pooling downward. Its pool spans the room and barely past its walls: the room's longer
## side × `fixture_reach_scale` + `fixture_reach_pad`, clamped.
static var fixture_color := Color(1.0, 0.62, 0.22)
static var fixture_energy := 0.8
static var fixture_reach_scale := 1.1
static var fixture_reach_pad := 60.0
static var fixture_reach_range := Vector2(300.0, 900.0)
## The rhythms a fixture's light is drawn from, by weight (the modes in light_rhythm.gd's header).
static var fixture_rhythms: Array = [[&"steady", 12.0], [&"failing", 1.0]]
# --- Flashes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A pool of point lights lit by the `shot` and `explosion` events (the 3 of the 15 point lights an
## item takes that the budget keeps free). Each kind: colour, energy, pool diameter (px; an
## explosion's at least `radius × reach_per_radius`), how long (s) it holds its full energy (`hold`,
## none when absent) and how long (s) it then falls off to dark (`life`). The stun's is its burst's
## whole look (no drawn disc, `PhysicsConfig.explosion_looks`): a far brighter white held an
## instant, then faded.
static var flash_pool := 3
static var flashes: Dictionary = {
	&"shot": { "color": Color(1.0, 0.82, 0.55), "energy": 1.6, "reach": 340.0, "life": 0.07 },
	&"frag": {
		"color": Color(1.0, 0.62, 0.3),

# --- Budget ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Godot 4.4 lights a canvas item with at most 15 point lights (the renderer stops gathering at
## MAX_LIGHTS_PER_ITEM - 1; directional lights are apart). A floor (with its walls and wear, one
## room's items) takes at most `item_lights` minus the flash pool of the piece and fixture lights: a
## light that would crowd a floor past it gets none (the piece still glows).
static var item_lights := 15
## A floor's items are counted out this far (px) past its rect: its walls and wear reach a little
## past the floor.
static var floor_reach := 8.0
# --- Characters -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A flash whose centre a living character stands within this many of its radii leaves the
## characters out of its shadows that frame: a body would black out the light it stands in (a muzzle
## flash, a blast at its feet). Only the flashes are shadowed by the characters.
static var body_clear := 1.3
# --- Textures -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The pool textures, by a light's `shape`: a round pool, a wide one (2:1, a screen's spill) and a
## tube's (3:1). Each fades smoothly (no rings) along one of two profiles, given as points (offsets
## out to the rim, 0..1, and the level there, joined linearly):
static var textures: Dictionary = {
	&"round": Vector2i(128, 128),
	&"wide": Vector2i(256, 128),
	&"tube": Vector2i(240, 80),
}
## A low light's glow (a screen, a tube, the flashes): brightest in the middle, fading out to
## nothing at the rim.
static var glow_offsets := PackedFloat32Array([0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0])
static var glow_levels := PackedFloat32Array([1.0, 0.82, 0.58, 0.34, 0.12, 0.0])
## An overhead light's pool (a fixture, a lamp, a street lamp): its cone meets the floor, so it is
## nearly flat out to half its radius, then fades quickly to the rim.
static var pool_offsets := PackedFloat32Array([0.0, 0.5, 0.65, 0.8, 0.92, 1.0])
static var pool_levels := PackedFloat32Array([1.0, 0.96, 0.75, 0.4, 0.12, 0.0])


## The most piece and fixture lights one floor may be reached by.
