class_name PhysicsLayers
## General domain: named physics-layer bits, shared read-only infrastructure (same role as
## Objects' `Wall.Side` enum) — a single source so "walls + solid furniture" isn't redefined
## as the same magic number in every file that raycasts against it.

## The layer walls, solid (non-see-over) furniture and bodies sit on: the line-of-sight/line-of-fire
## query layer used by AI perception (agent_vision.gd), its debug mirror (vision_debug.gd),
## Interaction (character_interaction.gd), the character's hands and legs, a dropped item, the
## bullet and Physics' wall sweeps.
