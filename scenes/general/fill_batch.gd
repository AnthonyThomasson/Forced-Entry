extends RefCounted
## General domain: plain-coloured shapes drawn on a canvas item as ONE triangle array (`flush`)
## instead of one polygon or circle command each, shared infrastructure (like `DrawLayers`) for any
## domain that draws many of them every frame. Rendering windowed, the engine builds a vertex buffer
## for every polygon command (`draw_colored_polygon`, `draw_circle`), about 9 µs each against a
## fifth of one for a rect: a body's limbs and shadow, a blood splat's outlines, a chunk of resting
## chips. A batch cuts each polygon into the triangles the engine itself would
## (`Geometry2D.triangulate_polygon`) and a circle into the 64-gon `draw_circle` draws (point `i` at
## angle `i * TAU / 64`; fanned from its first corner, which covers the same pixels as any cut of a
## convex polygon), and draws them all in the order they were added: the same shapes, so the same
## pixels. A batch is drawn at the canvas item's draw transform at `flush`: shapes added under
## different transforms are placed by the caller (`xform`). Under the headless display (`batching`
## false) nothing is rendered, a command costs no vertex buffer and building the array would cost
## more than the commands it replaces: there a batch hands each shape to its canvas as it is added.

## Whether shapes are gathered into one triangle array (else each is drawn by its own command as it
## is added): not under the headless display, whose renderer draws nothing.
