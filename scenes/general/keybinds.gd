## General domain: central place for all input actions, their default bindings and runtime
## rebinding.
##
## Autoloaded as `Keybinds` (see project.godot [autoload]). Everything that reads
## input should go through the constants and helpers here instead of hard-coding
## action-name strings. Each action holds exactly one binding, a key or a mouse button.
## The settings page edits them through `bind()` / `reset()`; `Settings` (also General)
## persists the differences from the defaults via `overrides()` / `apply_overrides()`.

## Action names. Use these constants instead of raw strings elsewhere.
