extends Node
## General domain: autoloaded as `GameClock`, the pausable game clock (interface 11). It counts
## physics frames in `_physics_process` and is `PROCESS_MODE_PAUSABLE`, so it stands still while the
## tree is paused: a pause of any length ages nothing measured on it. Its time is frames over
## `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`, so a headless `--fixed-fps` run reads the same times on every
## run, however fast it outpaces the wall clock. Every AI ttl, timer and age reads it
## (`docs/leadership.md` LD1); what measures real time (the Von server's boot timeout, Von's reply
## latency) stays on `Time`.
##
## An autoload node rather than a `class_name` holder (an autoload and a class cannot share a name):
## callers read `GameClock.msec()`, `GameClock.seconds()` and `GameClock.frame()` off the singleton.

## Physics frames run while the tree was unpaused, since the game started.
var _frames := 0


func _ready() -> void:
	process_mode = Node.PROCESS_MODE_PAUSABLE


func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:

## Game milliseconds since the game started: the drop-in for `Time.get_ticks_msec()` on the pausable
## clock.
func msec() -> int:
	return int(_frames * 1000.0 / Engine.physics_ticks_per_second)


## Game seconds since the game started.
func seconds() -> float:
	return float(_frames) / float(Engine.physics_ticks_per_second)


## Physics frames run while unpaused since the game started.
func frame() -> int:
	return _frames
