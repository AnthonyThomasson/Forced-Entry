extends Node
## General domain: autoloaded as `Despawner`. Any system that spawns transient world debris
## (casings, chips) hands the node to `track()`; once the live count passes `max_scene_objects` the
## oldest are freed, so the scene never accumulates debris without bound. Nodes that free themselves
## auto-drop out via their `tree_exited` signal.

## Max number of tracked debris objects allowed at once. Spawning past this frees
## the oldest. Owned here (the despawner is the only thing that reads it).
@export var max_scene_objects: int = 1000

## Live tracked objects, oldest first.
var _objects: Array[Node] = []


## Register a freshly spawned debris node. Enforces the cap immediately, so the
## oldest are freed the moment a new spawn pushes the count over the limit.

## Number of objects currently tracked.
