class_name Settings
## General domain: the player's saved settings — the debug switch, the key bindings that differ from
## the defaults, the last match-setup choices and the overlay toggles — kept in one JSON file. A
## `class_name` holder of `static var`s and static functions, read as `Settings.<name>`; there is no
## instance and no autoload.
##
## Main loads it once at startup (`load_file()`), so the headless test runner, which never loads
## `main.tscn`, never reads a developer's real file. The settings page's changes come back through
## the mutators here (`set_debug`, `set_setup`, `set_overlay`, `rebind`, `reset`, `reset_all`), each
## of which saves at once.
## Bindings live in `Keybinds.bindings`; this file only persists them and reshapes them for the
## page.

## Where the settings are stored. A test points it at a scratch file.
static var path: String = "user://settings.json"
## Master switch for the AI debug overlays and their in-game toggle bar. Main seeds it from its own
## export before `load_file()`, so a file that doesn't name it leaves that value standing.
static var debug: bool = true
## The match-setup window's last choices (`{ side, seed, lead, defenders, invaders }`, plain data as
## the window emits them), so it reopens the way it was left. Empty until something has been chosen.
static var setup: Dictionary = {}
## The overlay toggle bar's last states (`{ show_<x>: bool }`), so the overlays reopen as they were
## left. Only flags the player has toggled are stored; the rest keep Main's defaults.
static var overlays: Dictionary = {}


## Read the file: reset every binding to its default, then apply the saved differences, and take the
## saved `debug` and `setup`. A missing file leaves the defaults; an unreadable one warns and does
## the same; entries that aren't understood are skipped one by one.

## Remember the setup window's choices (`config`, as its `start_requested` carries them; only the
## parameters it reopens with are kept, not the start `mode`) and save.
static func set_setup(config: Dictionary) -> void:
	setup = {}
	for key in ["side", "seed", "lead", "defenders", "invaders"]:

## Remember one overlay toggle (`flag`, as the toggle bar emits it) and save.
static func set_overlay(flag: String, on: bool) -> void:
	overlays[flag] = on
	save()


## Bind `action` to the key or mouse button in `event` and save. Returns false (and changes nothing)
## when the event isn't something that can be bound.
static func rebind(action: String, event: InputEvent) -> bool:
	if not Keybinds.bindings.bind(action, event):
		return false
	save()

## Put `action` back on its default binding and save.
static func reset(action: String) -> void:
	Keybinds.bindings.reset(action)
	save()


## Put every binding back on its default and save. `debug` is left alone.
static func reset_all() -> void:
	Keybinds.bindings.reset_all()
	save()


## One plain dict per rebindable action, in display order, for the settings page:
## `{ action, label, group, text, conflicts: [labels of actions sharing the binding], changed }`.
