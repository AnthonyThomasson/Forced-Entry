class_name GameLog
## General domain: the game's "what is happening" log (shots landing, punches, house seed, Von
## decisions, perf numbers): one `say` that every domain prints through instead of `print`. On by
## default; the batch test runner turns it off so a test run shows only verdicts, and
## `tools/run_tests.sh --verbose` opts back in. Errors and warnings are not routed here — they
## always reach the engine log (and fail tests). A `class_name` static holder, like `PhysicsLayers`:
## there is no instance and no autoload.

## Whether `say` prints.
static var enabled: bool = true


## Print `message` when logging is on.
static func say(message: String) -> void:
	if enabled:
		print(message)
