class_name LightMasks
## General: the light masks every domain builds its shadows and light layers on (a `class_name`
## static holder, like `PhysicsLayers`, interface 11), so who shadows whom is decided in one place
## (`docs/lighting.md`) and no domain imports another for it. Objects (walls, solid pieces) and
## Character (the living body) build their own LightOccluder2D through `occluder`, as they build
## their colliders; Objects puts the street on `STREET`; the Lighting domain gives its lights the
## matching shadow masks and item layers.

# --- Occluder bits (`LightOccluder2D.occluder_light_mask`): an occluder shadows a light whose
# shadow mask holds its bit
## A 2D occluder has no height (its shadow runs to the rim of the light's pool), so who shadows whom
## is chosen by height instead: a light overhead is shadowed only by what reaches the ceiling (the
## walls), a low one also by what stands taller than a person (`TALL`), a flash at hand height by
## everything.
## A wall run.
const WALL := 1
## A solid piece that gives no light, lower than `TALL_COVERAGE`.
const FURNITURE := 2
## A solid piece that gives light: shadows only the flashes, never a piece's light (its own sits
## inside it, and a street lamp's own post would throw a shadow across the sidewalk).
const EMITTER := 4
## A living character (the dead cast none: a body on the floor would throw a wall-long shadow).
const CHARACTER := 8
## A solid piece that gives no light and stands taller than a person (a wardrobe, a fridge,
## shelving, lockers): it shadows the low lights too.
const TALL := 16
## The `coverage` (the hittable's 0..100 height) from which a piece is `TALL`: above a standing
## character's 60.
const TALL_COVERAGE := 75.0
# --- Shadow masks (`Light2D.shadow_item_cull_mask`) -----------------------------------------------
## An overhead light (a ceiling fixture, a standing lamp, the surgeon's lamp, a street lamp or
## sign): the walls only (they hang over the furniture and the characters).
const OVERHEAD_SHADOWS := WALL
## A low light (a screen, a neon tube, LEDs, a hotplate, neon trim): the walls and the tall pieces.
const LOW_SHADOWS := WALL | TALL
## A flash (a muzzle, a burst at hand height): everything.
const ALL_SHADOWS := WALL | FURNITURE | EMITTER | CHARACTER | TALL
# --- Item light layers (`CanvasItem.light_mask`; a light lights an item whose light mask meets its
# `range_item_cull_mask`)
## Godot's default: everything but the street.
const HOUSE := 1
## The street round a house: lit only by the street lamps, the flashes and its own unshadowed sky,
## so the house's lights never crowd a street floor (which spans the whole house) past the 15 point
## lights an item takes.
const STREET := 2

## Whether the domains build their occluders (the Testing domain's `lighting.enabled` switch turns
## it off with `LightingConfig.enabled`, so a world without lighting carries no occluder either).
static var shadows := true


## A LightOccluder2D over `polygon` (in the frame of the node it is added to) on occluder bit `bit`,
## wound and culled so the shape itself stays lit and only what lies behind it falls dark; null
## while `shadows` is off. The caller adds it as a child, so it follows its owner.
