class_name SoundConfig
## Tuning for the sound system (scenes/audio/). A `class_name` holder of `static var`s — read as
## `SoundConfig.<name>`; there is no instance and no autoload (the autoload is `Sound`, the
## service).
##
## Every sound is synthesized in code (SoundSynth) from a recipe SoundBank builds for a *profile*,
## then played by the `Sound` service through a small pool of positional voices. A sound belongs to
## one of eleven categories — `shot`, `impact`, `footstep`, `reload`, the grenades' `throw`,
## `grenade` (a bounce), `explosion` and `tinnitus`, and the vehicles' `engine` (a loop per running
## vehicle), `vehicle` (ignition, doors, crashes) and `skid` (a loop per sliding vehicle) — and the
## per-category tables below are keyed by those names.

## Master switch: off = the `Sound` service synthesizes, plays and posts nothing.
static var enabled: bool = true
## --- Mix ---
## Overall trim (dB) added to every voice.
static var master_db: float = 0.0
## Trim (dB) per category, on top of each profile's own level.
static var category_db: Dictionary = {
	&"shot": 0.0, &"impact": -2.0, &"footstep": -8.0, &"reload": -6.0, &"throw": -6.0,
	&"grenade": -4.0, &"explosion": 3.0, &"tinnitus": -4.0, &"engine": -9.0, &"vehicle": -2.0,
	&"skid": -7.0,
}
## Random pitch swing either side of 1 (0.06 = ±6%) on every play, so a burst of identical events
## does not sound like one sample machine-gunned.
static var pitch_jitter: float = 0.06
## Random volume swing (dB) either side of the level, on every play.
static var volume_jitter_db: float = 1.5
## Per-category multiplier on those two swings. Steps are heard over and over, so they swing wider
## (a repeating sound is what makes a walk sound mechanical).
static var category_jitter_scale: Dictionary = { &"footstep": 1.7 }
## --- Voices ---
## Most voices a category may have sounding at once; past it the oldest of that category is cut off.
static var category_voices: Dictionary = {
	&"shot": 6, &"impact": 8, &"footstep": 8, &"reload": 3, &"throw": 3, &"grenade": 4,
	&"explosion": 3, &"tinnitus": 1, &"engine": 4, &"vehicle": 6, &"skid": 3,
}
## Distance (px, at camera zoom 1) beyond which a category cannot be heard. The AI's own hearing
## radius (`hearing_radius`, 900) is the reference for how far a human-scale sound carries.
## A burst carries farther than a shot; the tinnitus is in the listener's own head, so it is never
## out of range.
static var category_range: Dictionary = {
	&"shot": 2400.0, &"impact": 1400.0, &"footstep": 900.0, &"reload": 800.0, &"throw": 900.0,

	&"vehicle": 1800.0, &"skid": 1600.0,
}
## True = the range grows as the camera zooms out (and shrinks as it zooms in), because Godot's 2D
## attenuation is measured in world px and a zoomed-out spectator would otherwise hear nothing.
static var range_follows_zoom: bool = true
## --- Deafness (G14) ---
## While the `Sound.focus` character is deafened, game audio (every voice but the tinnitus) goes
## through a low-pass at this cut-off (Hz) ...
static var muffle_cutoff_hz: float = 650.0
## ... which is open (this cut-off) when it is not.
static var muffle_open_hz: float = 20_500.0
## How fast the muffle closes and lifts, in fractions of the way per second (a bang cuts the sound
## in at once, the hearing returns slowly).
static var muffle_attack: float = 12.0
static var muffle_release: float = 0.9
## The tinnitus follows the deafness: its last this-many seconds fade out with it, and a stun
## shorter than `tinnitus_full_s` brings it in quieter.
static var tinnitus_tail: float = 1.5
static var tinnitus_full_s: float = 3.0
## --- Vehicles ---
## The engine loop's pitch with the engine idling at no revs (x) and at the redline (y); the revs
## (`engine_state().rpm`, 0..1) move it between the two, so it climbs through each gear and drops at
## the change.
static var engine_pitch: Vector2 = Vector2(0.85, 2.9)
## How much quieter (dB) the engine is off the throttle than on it, and how much louder at the
## redline than at no revs.
static var engine_load_db: float = 4.0
static var engine_rev_db: float = 3.0
## The skid loop is at full level from this `slip()` up (quieter below it), and pitched up by
## `skid_pitch` at full slip.
static var skid_full_slip: float = 0.4
static var skid_pitch: float = 0.18
## The skid loop is at full level from this vehicle speed (px/s) up, quieter below it (down to a
## quarter); a vehicle with no `speed()` is taken to be at it.
static var skid_full_speed: float = 200.0
## How fast (per second) a loop's pitch and level follow what they track, so a gear change or a
## sudden slide glides.
static var loop_ease: float = 14.0
## A crash at this closing speed (px/s) or faster is `medium`, at the second `heavy` (slower:
## `light`); within its band a crash is louder the faster, by the speed over `crash_speed_ref`
## (clamped).
static var crash_medium_speed: float = 150.0
static var crash_heavy_speed: float = 280.0
static var crash_speed_ref: float = 180.0
## --- Synthesis ---
## Sample rate (Hz) sounds are rendered at.
static var sample_rate: int = 22_050
## Louder than this (0..1) never leaves the synth: every sound is normalized to it.
static var peak: float = 0.9
## Distinct renders per profile; each play picks one at random, so repeats differ.
static var variants: int = 2
## Renders per profile for the categories that want more than `variants`: a step is heard far more
## often than a shot, so it has more different takes to draw from.
static var category_variants: Dictionary = {
	&"footstep": 6, &"grenade": 3, &"tinnitus": 1, &"engine": 1, &"skid": 1,
}
## A projectile's penetration power below this is "light" (SMG); the bands impacts are voiced in.
static var light_power_max: float = 0.9
## A projectile's penetration power from this up is "heavy" (rifle); between the two it is "medium"
## (pistol).
static var heavy_power_min: float = 1.6
## Seed of the private RNG that picks variants and jitter. Sound never touches the gameplay RNG.
static var rng_seed: int = 1177
## True = render the library in the background a few ms a frame after launch so no sound hitches the
## first time it plays. Skipped when there is no display (tests render lazily).
static var prewarm: bool = true
## Milliseconds a frame the background pre-render may take.
static var prewarm_budget_ms: float = 3.0
