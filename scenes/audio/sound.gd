extends Node
## Audio domain: the sound service, autoloaded as `Sound`. It listens to the EventBus and turns the
## events other domains post into positional sound, so emitters never reference it (and it never
## references them):
##   &"shot"      a gun fired        { position, gun, attacker, power }
##   &"hit"       a bullet or punch landed (only those carrying an `outcome`: blocked / penetrate /
##                ricochet / punch)             { position, outcome, material, power, speed_factor,
##                damage, … }
##   &"footfall"  a foot landed      { position, foot, speed, running }
##   &"reload"    a reload began (stage &"start": the magazine comes out) or finished (stage
##                &"done": the new one is seated and the action racked)   { position, gun, stage,
##                power }
##   &"throw"     a grenade left a hand           { position, kind }
##   &"grenade"   a thrown grenade bounced (stage &"bounce"; &"rest" is silent)   { position, kind,
##   stage } &"explosion" a grenade went off              { position, kind }
##   &"stun"      a character was flashed / banged; only a deafening of `focus` is voiced   {
##   character, deaf } &"vehicle"   a vehicle's ignition, door (open / close / slide_open /
##                slide_close), crash (+ speed, material) or a character struck (bump_character, +
##                speed)   { position, kind, stage }
##   &"engine"    a vehicle's engine started / stopped   { vehicle, kind, stage }
##   &"skid"      a vehicle's tyres began / stopped sliding   { vehicle, stage }
## Each becomes a *profile* (SoundBank), a rendered variant of it, and a voice: a pooled
## AudioStreamPlayer2D, capped per category with the oldest cut off first. The surface under a
## footfall comes from SoundSurface. Everything accepted is announced back on the bus as &"sound" {
## kind, profile, variant, position, volume_db, pitch } — what tests assert on and what a debug view
## could show.
##
## `focus` is the character whose ears this is (Main sets the human; nothing hears for an AI). While
## it is deafened (`stun.view().deaf`) `muffled()` is true: game audio goes through a low-pass on
## its own bus, closing at once and lifting slowly, and a tinnitus whine (a looping voice that
## follows the deafness and is cut when it ends) plays once per stun.
##
## A running engine and a sliding vehicle's tyres are loops: one looping voice per vehicle and kind
## (`loop_of`), started by the `engine` / `skid` start event and following the vehicle every frame,
## duck-typed like the focus (its position, and `engine_state()` rpm and load for the engine's pitch
## and level, `slip()` and `speed()` for the squeal's), until the stop event, the vehicle's engine
## stopping or the vehicle being freed.
##
## Randomness (which variant, pitch and volume jitter) comes from this node's own RNG, never the
## gameplay one. Voice lifetimes are counted in simulated time (`_now`), not read from the players,
## so a fixed-FPS test run that outpaces the clock frees them correctly.
