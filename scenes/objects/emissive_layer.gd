extends Node2D
## The light-source overlay of an Objects visuals node (a piece's, a floor's or a wall's): a child
## `Emissive` drawn over its art, drawing only what in that art gives light (a screen's face, a neon
## tube, a bulb: the pixels its painter drew `glowing`, ObjectArt.emissive) through the same
## geometry. Its own canvas item, drawn UNSHADED: neither the dusk ambient nor any light changes a
## light source, while the art under it is lit like anything else; the Lighting domain dims it with
## the piece's light (its `modulate`, through the piece's `get_lights()` `glow`). Draw-only, it
## reads nothing but its parent's `draw_emissive(canvas)`.
