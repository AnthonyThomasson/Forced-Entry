extends RigidBody2D
## An Objects-domain world object (furniture, decor). Owns its surface data (shape, size,
## color, cover/penetration ratings, material, mass) and composes three Physics components —
## a Knockback child (RigidBody2D adapter, how take_hit shoves it), a Deformable child (damage
## dents/chunks) and, on a solid piece, a BloodSmear child (drags blood out of a puddle). The engine
## integrates its motion, collisions and pivoting. It exposes the two contracts the rest of the game
## talks to it through, and nothing else:
##   • get_surface() / take_hit(HitInfo)  — the "hittable" contract (Projectile, melee)
##   • apply_impulse(Vector2, at) / get_mass() — the "pushable" contract (blasts, a character's
##     push, legs, punch, kick)
##   • get_lights() — the lights it gives (object_lights.gd), which the Lighting domain reads
##     duck-typed
## A solid piece also casts a shadow: a LightOccluder2D over its footprint (on General's
## `LightMasks`), a child so it follows a shove, built here like its collider.
## The force and deformation MATH lives in the Physics domain; this file only wires it up.

## (from the projectile), when swapping shapes is disallowed.

## then. Cutting the dented silhouette into convex pieces is the costly part of a rebuild, and a
## blast dents a room's worth of furniture at once: the cut is queued with the rebuild
## (`ColliderCuts`), and the first rebuild of the batch cuts the others on worker threads beside its
## own. The collider changes in its deferred rebuild, into the pieces a cut there would make.
