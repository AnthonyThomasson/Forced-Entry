extends Node2D
## Wall DRAW layer (Objects domain). Draws the wall caps, matching the colliders built by the
## control node (wall.gd): its pixel-art tile repeated along each segment, or a flat line when
## the wall has no art. Reads the geometry (`wall_segments()`), width (`wall_thickness`) and look
## (`art`, `art_color`, `art_opts`) from the parent, so this file owns appearance only. What in the
## cap tile gives light (`_emissive`; none of the caps glows) is drawn again by a child `Emissive`
## layer.
