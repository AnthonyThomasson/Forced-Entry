class_name WearFactory
## Objects-domain factory: turns where wear gathers in a room (World-Gen's placement: a few
## clusters, each by a wall, a corner or a piece of furniture, seeded) into the room's wear: a
## draw-only node (decals/room_wear.gd) that decides and draws each cluster's marks on the room's
## floor and wall. World-Gen never draws, and never touches the node's fields.

const RoomWear = preload("res://scenes/objects/decals/room_wear.gd")


## Build the wear of the room `rect` (in `parent`'s space) under `parent`: its floor is
## `floor_definition` (a catalogue floor: the marks follow its `art_opts.pattern` and colour), its
## walls `wall_thickness` thick, and `clusters` are `{ pos, wall, seed }` (the cluster's centre; the
## free stretch of wall it is by as `[a, b]`, its centre line between two points, or `[]`; the seed
## of its marks), all in `parent`'s space. Added after the house's floors and walls, so it draws
## over them. Returns the node (one per room: the CanvasItem drawing that room's wear).
