extends Node2D

## Floor CONTROL layer (Objects domain): one room's floor, or a piece of the street round a house — a rect covered in a
## repeating pixel-art tile, drawn beneath everything else in the house. It has no collider, so shots, navigation and
## perception all pass over it. Built by FloorFactory; drawing lives in floor_visuals.gd, which reads these fields. It tells
## the Physics blood flow where its grooves are and, unless `sound_surface` is off (the street: footsteps out there stay the
## open ground's), the Audio domain what it is made of. A floor of the street (`light_layer` `street`) is drawn, with
## everything under it, on the street's light layer (General's `LightMasks.STREET`). It joins the group `floors`, which the
## Lighting domain walks for its per-floor light budget.

@export var size: Vector2 = Vector2(100.0, 100.0)  ## Floor extent (px) from this node's origin.

@export var color: Color = Color(0.6, 0.5, 0.4)  ## Base color the tile is painted in.
@export var floor_material: String = ""  ## Material tag (the tile's surface finish).
@export var art_opts: Dictionary = {}  ## Painter options, e.g. { "pattern": "planks" }.
@export var sound_surface: bool = true  ## Registers with SoundSurface (off: footsteps on it sound like the open ground).

@export var marks: Dictionary = {}
## How far (px) into the repeating tile the floor's corner falls: 0 starts the tile at the corner (a room's floor); the
## street's pieces share one grid, so their slab joints meet.

## The light layer it is drawn on: `""` the house's (Godot's default), `street` the street's, lit only by the street lamps,
## the flashes and the street's own sky, so a floor spanning the whole house is never crowded by the house's lights.
