## The Objects domain's painter registry (private; read by the object, wall and floor visuals, the
## wear layer and the factory): maps an `art` id to its painter and renders it through the Art
## domain's PixelArt — at a cardinal facing for a piece, or at the painter's own tile size for a
## floor or wall tile — in the run-down look: every colour handed to a painter is graded first
## (decay.gd). Each texture has an EMISSIVE twin (`emissive` / `tile_emissive`): only the pixels its
## painter drew `glowing` (a screen's face, a tube, a bulb), for the visuals to draw as their
## light-source overlay.
