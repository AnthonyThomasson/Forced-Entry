class_name ColliderCuts
extends RefCounted
## Objects domain: the convex cuts of dented colliders that wait for their deferred rebuild, cut
## side by side on worker threads. Cutting a dented silhouette into convex pieces
## (`Deformation.cut_shape` / `cut_wall`) is the costly part of a collider rebuild, and a blast
## dents a room's worth of furniture and wall segments at once, each queueing its rebuild deferred
## (shapes cannot change mid-physics). When the first of those rebuilds runs, the dents are final
## (no hit lands between deferred calls): it starts every other waiting cut on a worker thread, each
## from a copy of its dents as they stand then, and cuts its own meanwhile; each later rebuild takes
## its finished cut. The same pieces, swapped in at the same moment, one rebuild after another; a
## piece hit several times in a frame is cut once, from all its dents.

## The cuts queued and not started, in the order queued.
