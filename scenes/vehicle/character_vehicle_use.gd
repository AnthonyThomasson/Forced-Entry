extends Node
## Vehicles domain: a character's use of vehicles (interface 19), composed by the character like its
## CharacterInteraction, which only forwards opaque calls to it: `try_use_vehicle()` (E: board by
## the nearest usable door, or get out), `vehicle()`, `is_in_vehicle()`, and once a physics frame
## `control(delta)` (after its controller, so the ride overrides that frame's intent) and
## `abandon()` on death. It finds vehicles through the group `vehicles` and steps the character's
## ride (vehicle_boarding.gd), which moves the character through its own walk and its ride API
## (`set_ride_pose`, `end_ride`). While the ride lasts the character keeps a collision exception
## with the vehicle; once it is out, it hands the vehicle to the character's `keep_clear_of`, which
## drops the exception as soon as the body has cleared the vehicle, so getting out never shoves it.

## The ride under way (VehicleBoarding), from the E press to the last step out; null on foot.
var _ride: RefCounted

## The character that composes it (character.gd).
@onready var _character: Node2D = get_parent()


## E: seated, get out (braking or waiting for the vehicle to slow first); on foot, board by the door
## whose handle is nearest, among those within `VehicleConfig.door_reach` of a vehicle moving slower
## than `board_max_speed`, skipping a door that cannot open for the next nearest. Nothing happens on
## the way in or out, or with no usable door.
