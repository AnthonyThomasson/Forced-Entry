## Vehicles domain: one character's ride in a vehicle, from E beside it to its last step back out
## (V3, V4), as a timed phase machine. The character's CharacterVehicleUse steps it every physics
## frame, after the controller has written its intent, so the machine is the character's controller
## for the ride:
##  - WALK: the character walks with its own walk cycle (`move_input`) round the body to the stand
##    point beside the door, turning smoothly (`aim_point`) to face the door as it arrives;
##  - OPEN: the door eases open while it stands;
##  - STEP_IN, FOLD: it steps into the gap, turns to face forward and folds down into the seat,
##    every frame a pose the vehicle carries (`set_ride_pose(position, facing, fold)`, positions
##    kept in the vehicle's frame);
##  - SEATED: the door shuts behind it; from the driver's seat its `move_input` / `run_input` drive
##    the vehicle. A passenger first slides across to an empty driver's seat (SHIFT_SEAT);
##  - BRAKE, SHIFT_OUT, OPEN_OUT, UNFOLD, STEP_OUT: getting out is the reverse, after braking to a
##    stop (a driver above `exit_max_speed`) or waiting for one (a passenger), by its own door if
##    clear, else the nearest clear one; it ends standing beside the door (`end_ride()`), which then
##    shuts behind it.
## Nothing interrupts it but death (`abandon`), which leaves the door as it is.
