class_name VehicleConfig
## Vehicles domain tuning (a static holder, like CharacterConfig): one row per kind of vehicle in
## `kinds`, and the numbers every vehicle shares (reach, the board and exit speeds, the door and
## fold times, harm and crash speeds). Distances are px, speeds px/s, accelerations px/s², angles
## rad. Rotation 0 = the nose toward +x; a vehicle's own frame has x forward and y toward its right
## side (its left side is toward -y).

# --- Getting in and out (V1-V4) ----------------------------------------------------------

## E picks a door whose handle is within this of the character.

## Boarding only while the vehicle moves slower than this.
static var board_max_speed: float = 20.0
## E while seated above this first brakes the vehicle to a stop (a driver) or waits for it (a
## passenger).
static var exit_max_speed: float = 20.0
## A swing or rear door eases open in this long (ease-out) and shut in this long (it gathers speed
## into the slam).

## The slide across the bench to another seat takes this long.
static var shift_time: float = 0.6
## The step into and out of the gap is taken at this share of the character's walk speed (its peak
## is 1.5x the average).
static var step_pace: float = 0.55
## The shortest step into or out of the gap (s).
static var step_min_time: float = 0.2
## How fast (rad/s) the character turns while it boards or gets out.

## Facing within this (rad) of the handle counts as facing the door, so the step in can begin.
static var face_tolerance: float = 0.25

static var stop_speed: float = 1.0
## S reverses (W drives forward again) only once the vehicle is this slow the other way.
static var reverse_engage_speed: float = 2.0
## The tyre impulses are solved this many times a frame (both axles together).

## A `skid` starts above this slip() and stops below the second.
static var skid_start_slip: float = 0.08
static var skid_stop_slip: float = 0.04
## The engine's gears: revs climb through each band of the top speed and drop at the change.
static var gears: int = 4
## Revs at idle, as a share of the redline.
static var idle_rpm: float = 0.18
# --- Collisions (V6) ---------------------------------------------------------------------
## A character struck slower than this (closing speed) is shoved, not hurt.
static var harm_min_speed: float = 90.0
## A character struck at this closing speed or faster is killed; between the two, hurt in
## proportion.
static var harm_kill_speed: float = 300.0
## How much of the closing speed a struck character bounces off with (0 = carried along at the
## vehicle's speed).
static var harm_bounce: float = 0.4
## A pile in front of the vehicle (a character struck and what it is pressed against, or a piece
## pressed against a character): bodies this close (px) along the push press on one another, at most
## this many are followed, and a piece's characters are looked for within this far (px) of it.
static var pile_gap: float = 4.0
static var pile_depth: int = 4
static var pile_reach: float = 150.0

## An impact faster than this posts a crash (or a bump on a character).
static var crash_min_speed: float = 60.0
## The body's dents: deepest (px) and how many are remembered.
static var dent_max_depth: float = 3.0

# --- Look (V3): the painters' colours, and each kind's `looks` row below ------------------
## The tyres' rubber and the hubs.
static var tyre_color: Color = Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.11)

## A van's cargo floor (plywood over the metal).
static var cargo_floor_color: Color = Color(0.45, 0.37, 0.27)
## The lamps: headlights, and the tail lights dark and lit (braking), with the glow a lit one throws
## on the ground.
static var headlight_color: Color = Color(0.93, 0.92, 0.82)
static var tail_off_color: Color = Color(0.46, 0.09, 0.08)

static var brake_glow: Color = Color(1.0, 0.15, 0.08, 0.3)
## Door glass fades out over the first this share of the door's opening (the window goes with the
## door).
static var glass_fade: float = 0.3
## The drawing is repainted when the wheels turn or a door moves this much (rad, open share), or the
## body this much (rad).
static var redraw_step: float = 0.02
static var redraw_turn_step: float = 0.01
## The look of each kind, in the vehicle's frame (x forward, y right; px): how deep the `bumper`s
## are; where the `bonnet` ends at the windscreen's base and the `boot` begins at the rear window's;
## the `roof` panel's front and back x and half width (`roof_half`); the `belt` line's half width
## (the doors' tops: side glass runs between it and the roof); the windscreen's half width at its
## base (`screen_half`) and the rear window's (`rear_half`); the fixed pillars between door glass
## (`pillars`: [back x, front x]); each door's glass (`glass`: door id -> [back x, front x]); a
## door's thickness seen from above (`door_depth`); the `dash`board's [back x, front x] and the
## steering `wheel`'s x; which doors carry a `mirror`; the lamps' half-width spans (`head` / `tail`:
## [inner, outer] |y|) and how long they are.

# --- The kinds ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## One row per kind. `size` is the body (length along x, width along y); `corner` its chamfer;
## `coverage`, `penetration` and `material` its ballistic surface (`get_surface`), `bounce` and
## `friction` its contact with what it strikes. `mass` is the rigid body's, `engine_force` (mass x
## px/s²) drives it up to `top_speed` (the speed full throttle settles at: the push tapers to
## exactly the rolling and drag there), `reverse_force` back to `reverse_speed`; `brake`,
## `handbrake_brake` and `rolling` are decelerations, `drag` the air drag (px/s² per (px/s)²).
## `axle_front` / `axle_rear` are the axles' x, `wheel_size` a wheel's (its look is the kind's
## `looks` row). The front wheels steer up to `steer_angle` (turned there in
## `steer_angle / steer_rate` s); at speed full lock is the angle whose turn asks the front axle for
## `steer_demand` of the grip it holds (1 = as hard as it holds; more scrubs the front wide).
## `grip_front` / `grip_rear` are the most sideways acceleration each axle holds before it slides
## (the rear the more, so at the limit the front lets go first and the vehicle runs wide rather than
## spinning); the handbrake leaves the rear `handbrake_grip` of its grip. `seats` are local points.
## `doors`: `id`, `kind` (`swing` turns about its front hinge, `slide` rolls back along the body,
## `rear` swings out behind about its back corner), `seat` (the seat behind it), `hinge` (where it
## turns, or a sliding door's front edge) and `handle` (where it is pulled, on the body's edge),
## `open_angle` for a swing or rear door.
