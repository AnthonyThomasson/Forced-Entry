## Vehicles domain: one door of a vehicle, in the vehicle's own frame (x forward, y toward its right
## side). It keeps the door's eased open amount, says where the door is as it opens (a `swing` door
## turns out about its front hinge, a `rear` door out behind about its back corner, a `slide` door
## rolls back along the body), where a character stands to use it and where the gap behind it is,
## and whether it is free to open: a shape query along its swing arc or slide track, and at the
## stand point. The vehicle steps it (`update`) and reads it out (`info`).

## Its id in the kind's `doors` row (`front_left`, `side` ...).

var handle: Vector2
## Hinge to handle (a sliding door: its length along the body).
var length: float
## How far (rad) a swing or rear door turns when fully open.
var open_angle: float
## Out of the body through this door (unit).
