extends RigidBody2D
## Vehicles domain: a drivable vehicle (a car or a van, `kind`, tuned by its `VehicleConfig.kinds`
## row). The control layer: a rigid body on `PhysicsLayers.SOLID` that the physics engine moves and
## collides, driven by the bicycle model (vehicle_drive.gd) inside `_integrate_forces` from the
## drive intent its driver hands on. It owns its doors (vehicle_door.gd) and seats, and the rides of
## the characters getting in and out (vehicle_boarding.gd, stepped by each character's
## CharacterVehicleUse). Drawing is vehicle_visuals.gd on the `Chassis` (under the occupants) and
## `Roof` (over them) children. Vehicles are found by the group `vehicles`.
##
## The drivable contract (interface 19): `doors()`, `seats()`, `driver()`, `board(character, door)`,
## `exit(character)`, `drive_input(...)`, and the reads `speed()`, `engine_state()`, `slip()`,
## `wheel_angle()`, `brake_lights()`, `view_zoom_out()`.
## It is also hittable like furniture (`get_surface` / `take_hit`: dents through Physics'
## Deformable, debris and a shove) and pushable through RigidBody2D's own `apply_impulse(v, at)` /
## `get_mass()`. Its contacts post crashes, and a character it strikes (directly, or through a piece
## of furniture pressed against it) is knocked back and hurt by the closing speed, the vehicle
## losing only the momentum the character and what it is pressed against take. The `vehicle`,
## `engine` and `skid` EventBus topics are posted here.
