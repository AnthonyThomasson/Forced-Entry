## Vehicles domain: the driving model, a bicycle. Stepped by the vehicle inside `_integrate_forces`,
## it turns the drive intent into the rigid body's velocities for the next physics step (the engine
## then moves the body and resolves its collisions):
##  - the steering eases toward the input; full lock is the kind's `steer_angle` while slow, and at
##    speed the angle whose turn asks the front tyres for `steer_demand` of the sideways grip they
##    hold, so full lock at any speed turns as hard as the tyres allow and no harder;
##  - the engine pushes along the front, tapering to just what holds the top speed against rolling
##    resistance and air drag, so full throttle settles at the top speed (S brakes, then reverses
##    once nearly stopped); rolling resistance and drag slow it, the brakes and handbrake harder,
##    and none of them ever turns it round;
##  - each axle cancels its sideways slip with an impulse up to its grip limit (the handbrake drops
##    the rear's), solved for both axles together, so a turn within the grip goes where the wheels
##    point and pivots about the rear axle, and past it the axle slides. The rear holds more than
##    the front (`grip_rear` over `grip_front`, weighed by where the axles sit), so at the limit the
##    front lets go first and the vehicle runs wide instead of spinning; the handbrake drops the
##    rear's grip and swings the tail out. What is left sliding is `slip`.
## All tuning is the kind's `VehicleConfig.kinds` row.
