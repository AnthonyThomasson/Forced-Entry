## Vehicles domain: a wheel seen from above, top-down pixel art (rendered through Art,
## `PixelArt.render_turned`): the tyre's tread rolling along it (canonical front, +y, the way it
## rolls), its rounded shoulders, and a glint of the hub on the outside face. Most of it hides under
## the body; a turned front wheel shows past the wing.

const _HEIGHT := 2
