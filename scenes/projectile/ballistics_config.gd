class_name BallisticsConfig
## Ballistics tuning for the Projectile System (scenes/projectile/projectile.gd).
##
## A `class_name` holder of `static var`s — read as `BallisticsConfig.<name>`; there
## is no instance and no autoload. Owns ONLY the shooting model: muzzle speed, the
## speed thresholds, and the fly-over / ricochet / penetration knobs. The force a hit
## imparts and the visual deformation it causes belong to the Physics System
## (PhysicsConfig); the character's walking-push knobs belong to CharacterConfig.
##
## A bullet is a multi-hit traveler: on each collider it either flies over (no effect, its one
## height is above the collider), ricochets, or penetrates (dealing damage, bleeding speed), and it
## frees itself once its speed drops below `projectile_min_speed` or it exceeds its own
## `max_distance`. Coverage/penetration come from the struck object's surface (see Objects'
## `get_surface()`, 0–100); a collider without a surface uses the `wall_*` fallbacks.

## Default projectile muzzle (top) speed in px/s. Copied onto each bullet's own
## `speed` at spawn (the projectile can still be overridden per-instance there).
static var projectile_speed: float = 3200.0
## Below this speed (px/s) a bullet is spent and frees itself. Head-on hits on hard
## material collapse speed past this in a hit or two, so walls naturally stop bullets.
static var projectile_min_speed: float = 800.0
## Minimum speed (px/s) required to penetrate. A bullet slower than this can no longer
## punch through a solid object: it's blocked — deals the impact and then stops
## (embeds). Fly-over and ricochet are unaffected. Set to the un-doubled muzzle speed,
## so penetration only happens in the upper half of the speed range.
static var penetration_min_speed: float = 1600.0
## Coverage/penetration used for a collider that exposes no `get_surface()`: full cover (never flown
## over) and high penetration.
static var wall_coverage: float = 100.0
static var wall_penetration: float = 100.0
## Coverage is a height on a 0–100 scale. Each bullet flies at one height for its whole flight and
## flies over every collider shorter than it, striking the taller ones. Drawn uniformly from 0–100
## at spawn, a bullet clears a collider of coverage C with chance (100 − C)/100: coverage 30 is
## cleared ~70% of the time and coverage 90 ~10%; coverage 100 is never flown over. The same height
## serves every collider along the flight: behind cover of 50, a body of 60 is struck only by the
## shots between 50 and 60 (or those that punch through the cover), while a crouched body of 35 is
## never reached by a shot that cleared the cover. Negative = random (the game); 0–100 pins every
## bullet to that height, which tests use to pick an outcome.
static var bullet_height: float = -1.0
## Scales the fly-over: the height a bullet needs to clear a collider is 100 − (100 − coverage) ×
## this. At 1.0 it is the coverage itself; at 0 nothing is flown over (every shot meets what it
## reaches); above 1 more is.
static var cover_flyover_scale: float = 1.0
## Ricochet: only material with penetration ≥ this can bounce, and only on a glancing
## hit (squareness < `bounce_square_max`). Head-on shots always penetrate instead.
static var penetration_bounce_min: float = 80.0
## Squareness (|dir · normal|, 1 = head-on) below which a hard hit ricochets.
static var bounce_square_max: float = 0.5
## Fraction of the (already squareness-scaled) damage a ricochet still deals.
static var bounce_damage_retention: float = 0.3
## Fraction of speed kept after a ricochet.
static var bounce_speed_retention: float = 0.6
## Penetration speed loss: loss = clamp((penetration/100) × this × (2 − squareness),
## 0, 1); speed ×= (1 − loss). Glancing hits (squareness→0) bleed more than head-on.
static var penetrate_loss_scale: float = 0.9
## Max random deflection on penetration, scaled by penetration/100. Degrees.
static var penetrate_deflect_max_deg: float = 12.0
## Exit point: after a bullet penetrates an object, how far past the entry (px) to look for the face
## it leaves by (a probe ray cast back toward the entry). Objects thicker than this report no exit.
static var exit_probe_distance: float = 80.0
## Blood carry: a bullet that passes through a surface with this material (a character's flesh)
## carries its blood; the first non-flesh surface it then hits within `blood_carry_distance` (px,
## measured from where it left the body) is marked with blood.
static var blood_material: StringName = &"flesh"
## Most px a bullet carries blood after leaving a body; the mark fades linearly to nothing at this
## distance.
static var blood_carry_distance: float = 160.0
