class_name Explosion
## Projectile System: the burst of a grenade, called by the thrown grenade (Items) when its fuse
## runs out. `frag` is the frag grenade's blast and fragments, `stun` the stun grenade's flash and
## bang (docs/grenades.md G7 to G12). `at` is the burst point, `world` the world root, `source` the
## thrower (null when gone) and `row` the grenade's `GrenadeConfig` row. Both post `&"explosion"`
## `{ position, kind, attacker, radius }` (the sound, the camera shake and the AI's perception hear
## it) and call `Physics.spawn_explosion` for its look. A grenade hurts and stuns everyone, its
## thrower and its own side included (G9).
##
## **The blast** reaches every hittable body with a clear line from the burst point within
## `blast_radius`, measured to its centre. A wall (a static body) stops the line; so does a piece of
## furniture whose `coverage` is above the body's own height (a character's is its posture's), which
## is what shields a crouched character behind a couch and not a standing one. Fragments fly at a
## height too, so they behave so already. What it reaches takes `take_hit` and is shoved away. **The
## flash** works by sight (the same line rule, the facing of the victim scaling it); **the bang** by
## range, through walls at `wall_factor` (a wall only: furniture muffles nothing).
