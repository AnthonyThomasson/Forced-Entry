## Composition-root helper (`main.gd`): where and how a match's NPCs are placed. Defenders go to a clear spot in a random room,
## invaders spread around the outside of the house; each NPC is added under the match's `World` node, handed the house's rooms and
## recorded in `combatants` (the spectator camera, the match HUD and the overlays observe that list). Like `main.gd` it knows the
## NPC scenes and the Navigation domain's `furniture_holes`; the placement rules live here so the root only wires domains.
