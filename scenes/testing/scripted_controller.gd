## Testing domain: a puppet controller — a character's `control(character, delta)` child (interface
## 7) driven by a test instead of a human or an AI. Commands are queued here and carried out on the
## character's own frame, through only the published controller API (`movement.move_input`,
## `movement.aim_point`, `movement.run_input`, `movement.set_posture`, `movement.toggle_crouch`,
## `weapon.melee`, `leg_kick`, `weapon.shoot`, `ammo.reload`, `inventory.select_slot`,
## `interact_with`, `end_interaction`, `try_use_vehicle`).
##
## Commands return at once; wait on their effect through the TestContext, e.g.
## `p.walk_to(spot)` then `await t.until(p.has_arrived, 3.0, "never arrived")`.

## How close (px) to a `walk_to` target counts as arrived.

## What to face: a Node2D (followed live), a Vector2 world point, or null (keep the last aim).
var _aim: Variant = null
## Walking target (world), or null.
var _walk_target: Variant = null
## Steady move direction (used when no walk target), 0–1 length.
var _move_dir := Vector2.ZERO
## Whether the puppet holds run.
var _run := false
## The posture the puppet wants, written every frame like the AI does (`&""` = leave it alone).
var _posture: StringName = &""
## Whether the puppet holds the trigger: an automatic gun keeps firing, a semi-auto one fires once
## per `shoot()`.
var _firing := false
## Actions waiting for the character's next frame: Callables taking the character.
var _pending: Array[Callable] = []
## Interactions started on the character's frame that reported failure (object, id) — for tests to

## Walk steadily along `direction` (normalized; zero stops).
func walk(direction: Vector2) -> void:

## Hold (or release) run; it takes effect while the puppet moves.

## Want a posture (`stand` or `crouch`): written to the character every frame, so it is taken as
## soon as the character allows. `&""` stops asking.
func set_posture(posture: StringName) -> void:

## Press C / Z once (the player's toggles), on the character's next frame.
func toggle_crouch() -> void:

## Use the held item's primary action (F: punch / jab).

## Kick with a leg (V), whatever is held.
func kick() -> void:

## Use the held item's secondary action once (a click of LMB: fire a round).
func shoot() -> void:
	_pending.append(func(c): c.weapon.shoot())

## allows. A semi-automatic gun is unaffected (it needs a `shoot()` per round).

## Press E once (the player's use-vehicle key): board the nearest door's seat, or get out. A
## character without `try_use_vehicle` ignores it, so a test written before the feature fails on its
## own `require`.

## is D, -1 is A (relative to the vehicle, which reads them); `handbrake` is the run key. Written as
## `Input.get_vector` gives them (W up = -y, length at most 1). `drive(0, 0, false)` lets go.
