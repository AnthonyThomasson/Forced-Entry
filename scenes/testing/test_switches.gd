extends RefCounted
## Testing domain: the ONE table of named behaviour switches a test turns on or off with
## `TestSetup.switch(name, on)`. Each row maps a name onto knobs that already exist, as data:
##   actor:  { child, props } — set each of `props` to `on` on that child of every actor that has it
##           (child "" = the character itself), before the actor enters the tree; `controller: true`
##           in place of `child` targets the actor's controller child (the one with `control`,
##           interface 7);
##   world:  { node, props }  — set each of `props` to `on` on that node of the built world;
##   static: [[Script, prop], …] — set each static var to `on`, restored after the test; a row
##           `[Script, prop, off_value]` is for a non-bool knob: on keeps its tuning, off sets
##           off_value.
## To add a switch, add a row; test_world.gd applies them generically.

## The switches, by name (the row shapes above).
