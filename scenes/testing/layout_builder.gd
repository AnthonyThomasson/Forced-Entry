## Testing domain: a hand-laid building — walled, floored rooms joined by doorways — made through
## the Objects factories (interface 2) in the house's own wall style. Returns a Node2D annotated
## through `WorldGen.annotate_layout`, so NavBuilder and WorldGen.get_rooms / get_openings work on
## it like on a house.


## Build the layout described by `world` (`{ rooms, doors, thickness }`, world-space) under `parent`
## and return its root. Each room gets its own walls with every door that lies on one of its edges
## cut in.
