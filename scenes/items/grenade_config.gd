class_name GrenadeConfig

## Tuning for the grenades (Items domain). Static vars, like the other config holders, so a test or
## tool can change them (tests restore them with `set_static`). One row per kind, by kind id
## (`GrenadeItem.kind`); the spec behind every number is `docs/grenades.md` (G1 to G19). The thrown
## grenade carries its row to the burst (`Explosion.frag` / `Explosion.stun`, Projectile System),
## which reads the effect numbers.
##
## Row keys, both kinds:
##   name           display name (HUD, and how the AI words it).
##   slot           the inventory slot / number key it lives in (`ItemRegistry`).
##   fuse           seconds from release to the burst (there is no cooking).
##   windup         seconds of drawn-back arm between the click and the grenade leaving the hand.
##   max_range      farthest (px) a throw first touches down; aimed past it, it comes down here and
##   rolls on a little. throw_speed    px/s it flies across the floor at full range (a shorter throw
##   is a slower, floatier lob). release_height height (px, the `coverage` scale) it leaves the hand
##   at. arc_height     height (px) the lob peaks at: furniture whose `coverage` is below the arc's
##                  height at that point is flown over, anything taller is struck.
##   restitution    share of its speed a bounce keeps (the floor's and a wall's).
##   friction       px/s² the floor skids it to a stop with.
##   looks          how it is drawn, per weapon style (`Item.style`: `police` issue, taped `scrap`,
##                  `pipe`; a style with no row draws `default_style`'s): `painter` (in the hand, in
##                  flight and at rest, items/art/), the colours of its `shell`, its fuze or `cap`
##                  and the `lever` held down in the hand, and of the marks the painter draws
##                  (`light` / `light2`, `trim`, `rust`, `tape`, `wire`, `band`, `fuse`), `finish`
##                  the shell's surface. Looks only.
## Frag only:
##   blast_radius, kill_radius, blast_damage   full damage out to `kill_radius`, falling linearly to
##   0 at `blast_radius`. blast_impulse  shove at the blast point (`apply_impulse` units), falling
##                  off with distance like the damage (furniture, living characters, ragdolls);
##                  `blast_max_speed` (px/s) caps the speed it gives a light body (a chair), mass x
##                  speed.
##   fragments, fragment_damage, fragment_speed, fragment_range, fragment_penetration   the real
##   projectiles it throws.
## Stun only:
##   flash_radius, flash_full, max_blind   blinded by sight within `flash_radius` (full inside
##   `flash_full`) for up to `max_blind` s. flash_cover_reach   a wall always stops the flash; a
##                  piece of furniture taller than the character only when the character is within
##                  this many px of it (hunched right against it): light comes round and over one
##                  that is not at its face.
##   bang_radius, max_deaf, wall_factor   deafened and disoriented by range for up to `max_deaf` s
##   (x`wall_factor` through a wall). point_blank, point_blank_damage   the only damage a stun does.

## The row for `kind` (empty for an unknown id).
