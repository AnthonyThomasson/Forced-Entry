class_name RifleItem extends GunItem
## Items domain: an assault rifle: a long automatic shouldered with the butt against the shoulder,
## the trigger hand at the grip and the other hand out on the foregrip, both lying along the barrel.
## Everything a gun does lives in `GunItem`, tuned by the rifle's `GunConfig` row (heavy, fast,
## penetrating rounds; its look too); this supplies its sizes and its hold. Its barrel is too long
## for a wall: touching one, it comes up off the aim, pointing up with the butt still on the
## shoulder, and cannot fire.

## The rifle's footprint lying flat on its side (px): its profile across, its length along.
const FLAT_SIZE := Vector2(12.0, 38.0)
## Rifle sprite footprint (px): width across, length from butt to muzzle.
const ART_SIZE := Vector2(7.0, 36.0)
## How far the butt end sits behind the hand's center (px): the hand grips the pistol grip, the butt
## is on the shoulder.
const GRIP_BACK := 13.0
## The kind of magazine it takes (`Magazine.gun`) and its `GunConfig` row.
const GUN := &"rifle"
