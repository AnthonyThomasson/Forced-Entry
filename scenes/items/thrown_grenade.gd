class_name ThrownGrenade extends Node2D
## A grenade let go into the world (Items domain): it flies a lob on a pseudo-height to the aim
## point, strikes walls and furniture taller than the arc is high there (the same `coverage` scale
## as everything else) and the characters in its way, bounces off them with energy loss, skids to a
## stop and goes off when its fuse runs out. Docs: `docs/grenades.md` G3, G6 and G10. A world
## `Node2D` like `DroppedItem`; nobody picks it up or throws it back. While it lives it is in the
## group `live_grenades` (`kind`, `fuse_left()`, `throw_stats()`, `thrower`) for perception to
## query.
##
## The lob is planned once at the throw (`plan`): its flight time and gravity are solved so the
## grenade comes to REST at the aim point (the touchdown, a bounce or two and the skid are simulated
## with the very integrator the node then runs), except that a throw is capped at the row's
## `max_range` of first touchdown, and rolls on a little past it. The plan is then flown over the
## floor it crosses (`_fit`): a grenade touches down short of the aim and skids the rest of the way,
## so a piece standing between the touchdown and the aim (a sofa in front of where it is aimed)
## would stop the skid and kick it back toward the thrower; the thrower then lobs it farther, over
## the piece, to touch down past it. On the fuse's end it calls the Projectile System's
## `Explosion.frag` / `Explosion.stun` with its `GrenadeConfig` row.
