class_name GunConfig

## Tuning for the guns (Items domain). Static vars, like the other config holders, so a test or tool
## can change them (tests restore them with `set_static`). One row per gun, by gun id (`GunItem.gun`
## / `Magazine.gun`); add a row, a `GunItem` subclass naming it and a case in
## `ItemRegistry._new_gun` to add a gun.
##
## Row keys:
##   name              display name (HUD, and how the AI words it: "Your pistol is loaded").
##   slot              the inventory slot / number key it lives in (`ItemRegistry`).
##   damage            added to the bullet's own base damage (`Projectile.damage`) at full speed,
##   head-on. fire_interval     seconds between rounds. One round per physics frame at most.
##   automatic         true = holding the trigger keeps firing; false = one round per press.
##   penetration       power multiplier for punching through what it hits (1 = the pistol): it
##                     divides the speed a bullet loses to a surface and lowers the speed it needs
##                     to get through.
##   muzzle_speed      px/s a round leaves at; damage and impact scale with the speed it still has.
##   spread_deg        random cone half-angle each round leaves within (0 = dead straight).
##   one_hand_spread_deg  added to `spread_deg` for a round fired one-handed (its user's other hand
##                     over its eyes, `Character.weapon.one_handed()`; docs/grenades.md G13).
##   recoil            scale of the kick the hands take per round (1 = the pistol's).
##   magazine          the `MagazineConfig.types` id it is loaded with when built.
##   spare_magazines   how many of that type a character who carries it also carries spare.
##   raises_at_contact the barrel is too long to fire at a wall: it points up and cannot shoot while
##                     it touches a wall or object (the pistol is short enough to fire point-blank).
##   art_size          the held art's footprint (px): width across, length from butt to muzzle.
##   flat_size         the art's footprint lying flat on its side (px): its profile across, its
##                     length along.
##   grip_back         how far (px) the butt end sits behind the weapon hand's centre.
##   grip_stance, fore_stance   how the weapon hand and the other hand are held (a
##                     `CharacterStanceConfig.stances` name).
##   raised_grip_stance, raised_fore_stance   the same while the weapon is raised off a wall or
##                     object.
##   looks             how it is drawn, per weapon style (`Item.style`: `police` issue, taped
##                     `scrap`, `pipe` guns; a style with no row draws `default_style`'s): `painter`
##                     (held and lying, items/art/) and the colours of its parts, `body` (slide or
##                     receiver), `stock`, `guard`, `grip`, `barrel`, `magazine` (seen lying) and
##                     the marks the painter draws (`light` / `light2` a light bar, `trim` a
##                     stencil, `rust`, `tape`, `wire`, `weld`), `finish` the receiver's surface.
##                     Looks only: nothing it does depends on them.

## How far ahead (px) of the body, on the aim line, every gun is zeroed: a round leaves the muzzle
## (a shouldered gun's is several px off the line) angled to cross the aim line there, so shots land
## where the character points at a normal range instead of running parallel to it.
