class_name GrenadeItem extends Item
## Items domain: a throwable held in the right hand: the logic the stun and the frag grenade share,
## driven by its row in `GrenadeConfig` (docs/grenades.md G1 to G6). It is a *count* carried in its
## slot (`uses_left()`), spent one per throw: left-click (`secondary`) starts a throw, the arm is
## drawn back in the `throw` stance for `windup` seconds (counted in `tick`), and then the grenade
## leaves the hand as a `ThrownGrenade` flying to the character's `aim_target()`. The fuse starts on
## release; there is no cooking. A character that dies, or puts the grenade away, during the wind-up
## throws nothing. When the last one is thrown the character empties the slot (`Character`). It is
## drawn in its weapon style (`Item.style`) by the row's look (`GrenadeConfig.look`: the painter and
## colours), and a thrown one keeps it. A subclass supplies only the kind id and the art's size
## (`StunGrenadeItem`, `FragGrenadeItem`).

## The kinds and styles whose art `prepaint` has painted: [kind, style] -> true.
static var _prepainted := {}

## The kind's id: its `GrenadeConfig` row. Set by the subclass.
var kind: StringName = &""
## Grenades left in this slot.

## Seconds until the grenade leaves the hand; negative = no throw under way.
