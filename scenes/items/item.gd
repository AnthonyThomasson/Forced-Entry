class_name Item extends RefCounted
## Items domain: base class for a thing the character can hold and act with. An Item is pure
## behaviour + a little state (e.g. which fist punches next); it owns what the primary (F) and
## secondary (LMB) actions do, how each hand is held, how its weapon is rendered, and what it leaves
## behind when its user dies (drop).
## The character calls into these; an Item talks back only through the small character API
## (facing, weapon.facing(), weapon.raise(), punch(), punch_amount(), weapon.kick(),
## hand_position(), hand_world(), weapon.muzzle_origin(), world_root(), report_shot(),
## weapon.aim_target(), weapon.aim_sway(), weapon.one_handed(), current_item(), and for reloading
## ammo.best_magazine() / ammo.take_magazine() / ammo.stow_magazine()), so Items and the Character
## are otherwise independent.

## Punch reach (px), read by the hands to size the swing.

## True while the character is reloading this item (the character sets and clears it).
var reloading := false
## The weapon style it is drawn in, its wielder's (`police` issue for the invaders, `scrap` or
## `pipe` for a defender): stamped on every item a loadout makes (`ItemRegistry.inventory_for`, from
## `LoadoutConfig.apply`). An item never given one is `police`. A gun or grenade draws its config
## row's look for it (`GunConfig.look` / `GrenadeConfig.look`); a dropped gun and a thrown grenade
## keep it. Looks only: nothing it does depends on it.

## The textures the last frame's draws of the item painted, in order (`drawn_art`).

## How `hand` (0 = right as drawn, 1 = left) is held while this item is out: the name of a stance in
## CharacterStanceConfig.stances — "relaxed" (arm hanging), "guard" (fists up), "aim" (arm out,
## steady, holding a weapon) or "support" (cupping the aiming hand). Default: relaxed.
func hand_stance(_hand: int) -> StringName:
	return &"relaxed"


## Primary action (F). Default: nothing (unarmed).
func primary(_user: Node2D) -> void:

## Secondary action (left-click); true when it did something (a gun: a round left the barrel).
## Default: nothing.
func secondary(_user: Node2D) -> bool:
	return false


## Advance the item's own clocks (a gun's time between rounds) by `delta` seconds. The character
## ticks every item it carries once per physics frame, held or not. Default: nothing.
func tick(_delta: float) -> void:
	pass


## Whether holding the trigger keeps repeating the secondary action (a controller re-presses it
## every frame) instead of needing a fresh press each time. Default: no.
func is_automatic() -> bool:
	return false


## The hand that holds this item's weapon (the muzzle and the recoil are that hand's). Default: the
## right (hand 0).
func weapon_hand() -> int:

## How far past the weapon hand the muzzle is (px): bullets leave there, and a long gun reaches
## further. Default: negative, meaning the character's own default reach.
func muzzle_ahead() -> float:
	return -1.0


## How far (px) behind the weapon hand this item's striking end sits when held, which a melee blow
## swings round to lead with (a long gun's butt). 0 = the fist leads.
func strike_ahead() -> float:
	return 0.0


## How far (rad) the weapon turns about the weapon hand, outward from the body, by the end of a
## blow: short of a half turn, so it ends nearly across the body with the striking end a little
## ahead of the far end.

## punch `amount`.
func strike_end(aim: Vector2, amount: float) -> Vector2:
	return -strike_direction(aim, amount) * strike_ahead()


## How far (px) ahead of the weapon hand the striking end ends up at a full blow: the hands shorten
## the punch's extension by it, so a blow lands as far out as ever.
func strike_forward() -> float:
	return strike_ahead() * maxf(-cos(strike_turn()), 0.0)


## How much (px) shorter than a fist's the blow reaches: a weapon held in both hands cannot be
## thrown as far.
func strike_short() -> float:
	return 0.0


## How far (px) along the weapon from the weapon hand the other hand grips (negative: toward the
## striking end). It holds on as the weapon turns. 0 = it does not follow.
func strike_support_gap() -> float:
	return 0.0


## How many times slower than a fist the weapon's blow is thrown (a heavy weapon swings, it does not
## jab).
func strike_tempo() -> float:
	return 1.0


## Whether the weapon is too long to use against a wall: while its barrel touches a wall or object
## it is held pointing up and cannot shoot. Default: no.
func raises_at_contact() -> bool:
	return false


## How `hand` is held while the weapon is raised off a wall or object (a
## `CharacterStanceConfig.stances` name). Default: held as usual.

## Rounds loaded right now, or -1 for an item with no ammo (the default).

## Rounds a full load holds, or -1 for an item with no ammo (the default).

## The id of the gun this item is (a `GunConfig` row), or &"" for an item that is not a gun (the
## default).
func gun_id() -> StringName:

## The penetration power of the rounds it fires (1 = a pistol round); 1 for an item that fires none
## (the default).
func round_power() -> float:

## How many uses are left: a grenade's count, spent one per throw. -1 for an item that is never used
## up (the default).

func is_throwable() -> bool:
	return false


## What a holder may know of a throwable before throwing it, `{ kind, max_range, danger_radius,
## fuse, flash_cover_reach, max_blind }` (a grenade's numbers: how far a throw first comes down, how
## far its burst reaches, the seconds to it, how near furniture must be to shield from a flash).
## Default: nothing ({}), as for every item that is not thrown.
func throw_stats() -> Dictionary:
	return {}


## Seconds a reload of this item takes. Default: 0 (instant).

## Whether reloading would change anything: a carried magazine fuller than what is loaded. Default:
## no.
func can_reload(_user: Node2D) -> bool:

## The reload time is up: swap the loaded magazine for a carried one (through the character's
## best_magazine / take_magazine / stow_magazine). Default: nothing.
func finish_reload(_user: Node2D) -> void:
	pass


## The textures the item's last draw (`draw_weapon` or `draw_dropped`, every call in the frame it
## was last drawn: a lying item's shadow and art) painted, in order. Pixel art is cached by what it
## depicts, so the same drawing gives the same textures and a changed look new ones. Empty for an
## item never drawn or that draws nothing.
func drawn_art() -> Array:

## Record `tex` as painted by this frame's draw of the item (`drawn_art`).

## Paint ahead of time the art this item can be drawn with, so no first paint lands mid-fight
## (`ItemRegistry` asks every item it makes). Only fills PixelArt's cache with the textures the
## draws would paint: what is drawn never changes. Default: none.
func prepaint() -> void:
	pass


## Draw the item's weapon art onto `canvas` (the character's visuals Node2D). Default: none.
func draw_weapon(_canvas: CanvasItem, _user: Object) -> void:

## Let go of the item into the world (its user has died), flying off at `velocity`; returns the
## dropped node, or null when nothing is left behind (the default).
func drop(_user: Node2D, _velocity: Vector2) -> Node2D:
	return null


## Draw the item lying loose, centered at `at` on `canvas` and pointing along `angle`, tinted by
## `modulate` (its art, or its shadow). `opts` is how it landed, picked once when dropped
## (`flip`: which side faces up). Default: none.
