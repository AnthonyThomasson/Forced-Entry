class_name SmgItem extends GunItem
## Items domain: a submachine gun: a compact automatic held in both hands with its butt on the right
## shoulder, a longer reach than a pistol but nowhere near a rifle. Everything a gun does lives in
## `GunItem`, tuned by the SMG's `GunConfig` row (fast, light rounds, a wide spread; its look too);
## this supplies its sizes and its hold. Its barrel is too long for a wall: touching one, it points
## up and cannot fire.

## The SMG's footprint lying flat on its side (px): its profile across, its length along.
const FLAT_SIZE := Vector2(11.0, 22.0)
## SMG sprite footprint (px): width across, length from butt to muzzle.
const ART_SIZE := Vector2(6.0, 28.0)
## How far the butt end sits behind the hand's center (px): the hand grips the pistol grip, the butt
## is on the right shoulder.
const GRIP_BACK := 10.0
## The kind of magazine it takes (`Magazine.gun`) and its `GunConfig` row.
const GUN := &"smg"
