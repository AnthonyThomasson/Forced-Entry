class_name GunItem extends Item
## Items domain: a gun held in the right hand: the logic every firearm shares, driven by its row in
## `GunConfig` (damage, fire rate, penetration, muzzle speed, spread, recoil, whether it is
## automatic and whether its barrel is too long to use against a wall). F still jabs with the weapon
## hand (melee); left-click fires a projectile and ejects a casing. It is drawn in its weapon style
## (`Item.style`) by the row's look (`GunConfig.look`: the painter and colours). A subclass supplies
## only its sizes and how it is held (`PistolItem`, `SmgItem`, `RifleItem`): the gun id, the art's
## footprints, where the hand grips it and the stances. Items reach into the Projectile System in
## two places: here, via ProjectileSpawner / CasingSpawner (a shot's `hit` is forwarded back to the
## character's `report_shot` for the HUD), and ThrownGrenade, via `Explosion.frag` /
## `Explosion.stun`.

## How far the pulled-up barrel shortens at full raise (fraction of its length): pointed up, a
## top-down view sees it foreshortened. The art is re-rendered at `RAISE_STEPS` lengths between full
## and this, so it stays crisp and cached.
const RAISED_LENGTH := 0.42
const RAISE_STEPS := 5
## How far (px) along a long gun's barrel from the weapon hand the support hand grips through a butt
## strike: toward the butt, so the other arm does not reach across the weapon hand.
const SUPPORT_GAP := -8.0
## How far (rad) a long gun turns in a butt strike: nearly across the body (105 degrees), the butt a
## little ahead of the muzzle.
const STRIKE_TURN := 1.833
## How far (px) short of a fist's reach a long gun's blow lands.
const STRIKE_SHORT := 5.0

## The guns and styles whose art `prepaint` has painted: [gun, style] -> true.
static var _prepainted := {}

## The gun's id: its `GunConfig` row and the kind of magazine it takes (`Magazine.gun`). Set by the
## subclass.
var gun: StringName = &""
## The magazine it is loaded with (null = unloaded); every shot spends one of its rounds.
var magazine: Magazine
## Seconds until the next round may leave. Counts down in `tick`; firing adds the fire interval, so
## an overshoot carries into the next round and the rate holds even when it is not a whole number of
## frames.

# --- What a subclass supplies: sizes and hold --------------------------------------------------


## The held art's footprint (px): width across, length from butt to muzzle.
func art_size() -> Vector2:
	return Vector2(5.0, 13.0)


## The flat art's footprint (px): its profile across, its length along.
func flat_size() -> Vector2:
	return Vector2(9.0, 14.0)


## How far the butt end sits behind the weapon hand's center (px).
func grip_back() -> float:
	return 2.0


## The weapon hand's stance, held normally.
func grip_stance() -> StringName:
	return &"aim"


## The other hand's stance, held normally.
func fore_stance() -> StringName:
	return &"support"


## The weapon hand's stance while the weapon is raised off a wall or object.
func raised_grip_stance() -> StringName:
	return grip_stance()


## The other hand's stance while the weapon is raised off a wall or object.
func raised_fore_stance() -> StringName:
	return fore_stance()


# --- Stats (read live from GunConfig, so tuning it takes effect at once) ---------------------


## A value from this gun's `GunConfig` row (`fallback` when the row has none).
func stat(key: String, fallback: Variant = null) -> Variant:
	return GunConfig.row(gun).get(key, fallback)


## Damage added on top of the projectile's own base damage at fire time.
func damage() -> float:
	return float(stat("damage", 0.0))


## Seconds between rounds.
func fire_interval() -> float:
	return float(stat("fire_interval", 0.0))


## How it is drawn: its row's look in its weapon style (`GunConfig.look`: `painter`, colours,
## `finish`).
func look() -> Dictionary:
	return GunConfig.look(gun, style)


# --- Item contract --------------------------------------------------------------------------


## The gun's id.
func gun_id() -> StringName:
	return gun


## The penetration power of its rounds (the row's `penetration`).
func round_power() -> float:
	return float(stat("penetration", 1.0))


## The weapon hand aims the gun and holds its grip; the other hand holds it forward, or while
## reloading drops to the belt for the next magazine.
func hand_stance(hand: int) -> StringName:
	if hand == weapon_hand():
		return grip_stance()
	return &"reload" if reloading else fore_stance()


## How `hand` is held while the weapon is raised: the weapon hand's raised stance; the other hand's,
## or the belt while reloading.
func raised_stance(hand: int) -> StringName:

		return raised_grip_stance()
	return &"reload" if reloading else raised_fore_stance()


## Whether holding the trigger keeps firing (the row's `automatic`).
func is_automatic() -> bool:

## Whether the barrel is too long to use against a wall (the row's `raises_at_contact`).
func raises_at_contact() -> bool:
	return bool(stat("raises_at_contact", false))


## Past the hand: the art's length less the butt behind it.
func muzzle_ahead() -> float:
	return art_size().y - grip_back()


## Count the time between rounds down. The credit for an overshoot is capped at one frame, so a gun
## left idle fires its next round at once but never a burst to catch up.
func tick(delta: float) -> void:
	_cooldown = maxf(_cooldown - delta, -delta)


## Rounds left in the loaded magazine (0 when unloaded).
func rounds_loaded() -> int:
	return magazine.rounds if magazine else 0


## Rounds the loaded magazine holds when full (0 when unloaded).
func ammo_capacity() -> int:
	return magazine.capacity if magazine else 0


## How long a reload takes: the loaded magazine's type decides (`MagazineConfig.reload_time_of`).
func reload_time() -> float:

	return MagazineConfig.reload_time_of(type)


## A carried magazine holds more rounds than the one loaded.
func can_reload(user) -> bool:
	var best: Magazine = user.best_magazine(gun)
	return best != null and best.rounds > rounds_loaded()


## Seat the fullest carried magazine; the one it replaces goes back into the carried store unless it
## is empty (nothing refills a magazine, so an empty one is dropped).
func finish_reload(user) -> void:
	var fresh: Magazine = user.take_magazine(gun)
	if fresh == null:
		return
	var spent := magazine
	magazine = fresh
	if spent != null and spent.rounds > 0:

## A long gun (the kind too long for a wall) strikes with its butt: its length behind the grip.
func strike_ahead() -> float:
	return grip_back() if raises_at_contact() else 0.0


## How far (px) the other hand grips ahead of the weapon hand along the barrel: it holds the gun
## through a butt strike.
func strike_support_gap() -> float:
	return SUPPORT_GAP if raises_at_contact() else 0.0


## A long gun swung in both hands lands a little short of a fist's reach, which keeps the support
## arm from overstretching.
func strike_short() -> float:
	return STRIKE_SHORT if raises_at_contact() else 0.0


## A long gun turns nearly across the body in a butt strike.
func strike_turn() -> float:
	return STRIKE_TURN if raises_at_contact() else 0.0


## A long gun is swung twice as slowly as a fist is thrown.
func strike_tempo() -> float:
	return 2.0 if raises_at_contact() else 1.0


## F: a melee jab with the weapon hand; a long gun swings round and leads with its butt.
func primary(user) -> void:
	user.punch(weapon_hand())


## LMB: fire a bullet from the muzzle and eject a casing (both live in world space); the gun kicks
## the hand back. Spends a round; an empty, mid-reload or still-cycling gun does nothing. The round
## leaves within the gun's spread of the aim, wider by its `one_hand_spread_deg` while its user
## holds it in one hand (`one_handed()`). True when a round left the barrel.
