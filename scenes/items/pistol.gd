class_name PistolItem extends GunItem
## Items domain: a pistol held in the right hand: short enough to fire point-blank at a wall, held
## at arm's length with the other hand cupping the grip. Everything a gun does lives in `GunItem`,
## tuned by the pistol's `GunConfig` row (its look too); this supplies its sizes and its hold.

## The pistol's footprint lying flat on its side (px): its profile across, its length along.
const FLAT_SIZE := Vector2(9.0, 14.0)
## Pistol sprite footprint (px): width across, length from grip to muzzle.
const ART_SIZE := Vector2(5.0, 13.0)
## How far the grip end sits behind the hand's center (px).
const GRIP_BACK := 2.0
## The kind of magazine it takes (`Magazine.gun`) and its `GunConfig` row.
const GUN := &"pistol"
