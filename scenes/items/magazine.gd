class_name Magazine extends Item
## Items domain: a magazine of rounds for a gun. It is carried, never held: it lives in the
## character's magazine store, not in an inventory slot, so no number key selects it and several can
## be carried at once. Different types hold different amounts (`MagazineConfig.types`). A gun is
## loaded with one, shooting spends its rounds, and a reload swaps it for another carried one.

## Which row of `MagazineConfig.types` this is.
var type: StringName = &"standard"
## The kind of gun it fits (a `GunConfig` id, e.g. `PistolItem.GUN`).
var gun: StringName = &"pistol"
## Rounds it holds when full.
var capacity := 0
## Rounds left in it.
var rounds := 0


## A magazine of `type` holding `loaded` rounds (negative = full, and never more than it can hold).
