# Claude Code Stop hook: when the turn changed what the lint reads, run the fast checks (GDScript lint + headless load
# check) and, on failure, block the stop (exit 2) so the agent sees the errors and keeps working. The game
# tests run on commit instead (.githooks/pre-commit).
#
# Skips silently when: the hook already fired this turn (stop_hook_active — no loops), nothing the lint reads
# changed, or those files are identical to the last run (so an unfixed failure is reported once, not on every stop).
# What the lint reads: scenes/ tests/ addons/ sandboxes/ and project.godot (addons/ because a lint rule,
# coverage_isolation, checks it), every other .gd (tools/gdunit_discover.gd, tools/coverage/probe.gd ...) but the
# coverage tool's fixture project, which the lint leaves out, the gdstyle pass's own files, and the lint and the load
# check themselves (tools/lint.sh, tools/lint_rules/, tools/lint_report.py, tools/lint_scripts.gd / .tscn,
# tools/load_check.sh). Wired in .claude/settings.json.
