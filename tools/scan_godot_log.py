"""Fail when a Godot log holds an error or warning.

  python3 tools/scan_godot_log.py LOG [--from=BYTES] [--strict-exit]

Reads LOG (written by `godot --log-file LOG`) from byte BYTES (default 0) to the end and prints every error / warning
entry; exit 1 when there is one, 0 when the part scanned is clean. tools/run_tests.sh scans what the engine wrote
after the test runner stopped judging the log (`log_end` in its report) and the whole log when the runner never got
that far; tools/load_check.sh scans a plain headless start-up.

The header list mirrors scenes/testing/log_watch.gd, which does the same job inside the running game.

One class of output is reported as a NOTE and does not fail the scan unless --strict-exit is given: Godot's own
end-of-process leak report ("ObjectDB instances leaked at exit", "resources still in use at exit", "RID
allocations ... leaked at exit", the SelfList `p_elem->_root != this` line printed beside it). The engine prints it
when the process tears down with script resources still referenced; a run that touches a character together with
a reflectively read config holder (e.g. `CharacterStunConfig`) shows it, whatever the test checks.
