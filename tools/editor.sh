# Open a Godot editor on a worktree, named after it, unless one is already running there.
#
#   tools/editor.sh                       editor on this checkout, named after the worktree directory
#   tools/editor.sh --autorun             also presses Play once the editor is up
#   tools/editor.sh --port=9123           command-server port (default: 9080 + hash(name) % 500, moved up to the next free one)
#   tools/editor.sh /path/worktree        a different worktree (named after its directory)
#   tools/editor.sh NAME                  override the name (any argument that is not a directory)
#
# If an editor is already open on that worktree no editor is started: its pid, port and log are
# printed instead (the port is read from the running editor's GODOT_CMD_PORT). With --autorun and no
# game running on that port, the game window is opened on its own (same name and port) instead.
# The name travels as GAME_TICKET (the editor's game child inherits it; Main shows it atop the
# setup menu). The command server listens on GODOT_CMD_PORT, so worktrees don't collide:
#   python3 tools/gcmd.py --port <printed port> 'scene().name'
# The editor runs detached; its log path and pid are printed. The game its Play starts is given an engine log of its
# own, `$TMPDIR/game_<name>.engine.log` (GAME_LOG_FILE, which addons/ticket_autorun makes the game's `--log-file`): the
# test runner in it reads only its own process's errors, never another Godot's from the shared user://logs/godot.log.
