# Selecting tests
#   tools/run_tests.sh                    every test (Von tests skipped)
#   tools/run_tests.sh projectile         only tests matching "projectile" (id, name, domain, tag;
#                                         every word must start a word of one of those)
#   tools/run_tests.sh --domain=ai        only the tests of exactly that domain; comma list allowed
#                                         (--domain=ai,navigation). No word-prefix matching.
#   tools/run_tests.sh --id=ai/foo_bar    exactly that test id (comma list allowed)
#   tools/run_tests.sh --skip-domain=perf leave out the tests of exactly that domain (comma list allowed); wins over
#                                         every other selection, --changed's included. The pre-commit hook skips perf:
#                                         its frame-time budgets fail on a loaded machine, so they are a separate run.
#   tools/run_tests.sh --failed           only the tests that FAILED / TIMED OUT in the previous run
#                                         of this checkout (its report is kept in $TMPDIR)
#   tools/run_tests.sh --changed          tests for what uncommitted changes can affect: each changed
#                                         scenes/<domain>/ plus the domains that compose it (see
#                                         `affected` below), in ONE run; main.gd, root scenes,
#                                         project.godot, worldgen, art and general run everything;
#                                         testing adds --self-test. An edited tests/<d>/[<topic>/]<name>_test.gd
#                                         runs just that test; tests/_ai, _audio, _perf, _vehicle their users.
#   tools/run_tests.sh --list [words]     list matching tests (id, flags, tags, name) and exit
#   tools/run_tests.sh --include-von ai   also run tests that need the Von decision server
#   tools/run_tests.sh --require-von ai   Von tests FAIL instead of skipping when no server is live
#   tools/run_tests.sh gap                the tests tagged `gap`: specs the code does not meet yet, written first and
#                                         left red; their failure is reported as GAP and does not fail the run, and one
#                                         that passes FAILs ("drop the gap tag")
#   tools/run_tests.sh --self-test        the harness's own tests (tests/_harness, hidden from normal runs)
# Speed
#   --jobs=N|auto   split the run over N parallel godot processes (auto = cores, at most 6). Without it, a run of the
#                   whole suite uses auto and a selection (words, --id, --domain, --failed, --repeat) one process. The
#                   tests are dealt out to balance the shards by the wall-clock ms measured in earlier runs (kept in
#                   $TMPDIR, falling back to the declared timeout); Von tests all stay in shard 0. One combined
#                   summary and slowest list is printed; exit 1 if any shard failed. Not used with --list/--self-test.
#   --fail-fast     stop after the first FAIL / TIMEOUT (per shard when sharded)
# Output
#   --summary       print only the non-passing tests and the totals (best for an agent or a hook)
#   --verbose       also print the game's log of what happens (shots, punches, Von decisions, PERF
#                   numbers); a run is quiet by default
#   --json          also print the full results as one `JSON: {...}` line
#   --shots         windowed run (not headless) that saves a PNG of each failed test
#   --windowed      windowed run with vsync off, in one process: a perf test's frame times then include the render
#                   (headless measures the CPU only) without being held to the display's refresh
# Other
#   --repeat=5      run each match 5 times; names FLAKY / FAILING tests
#   --seed=42       pin every house() test to seed 42
#   --strict-exit   also fail on Godot's own end-of-process leak report (reported as a NOTE by default)
#   --no-lint       skip the GDScript lint that runs first (tools/lint.sh, ~5 s: unused variables, integer
#                   division, shadowed names ... the warnings of the editor's Debugger > Errors tab). Any warning
#                   fails the run before a single test starts. Not run for --list or --self-test, nor when
#                   the sources are unchanged since the last clean lint (fingerprint kept in $TMPDIR).
# Not here: --play <words> (play one test or sandbox in the runner) is the runner's own flag; this wrapper only runs
# batches, so it refuses --play and prints the command that launches the runner.
# Every run ends with a `Slowest:` line (wall-clock ms per test).
# A failed test prints its final actor state and a `bundle:` path to a JSON with its event log,
# state and traces. Each invocation gets its own engine log, report and bundles in a fresh temp dir
# (printed as `Report:` / `bundle:`), so concurrent runs and a running game never share files.
