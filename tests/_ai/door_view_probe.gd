## Shared helpers for the doorway-view tests (not a test itself):
## `const View := preload("res://tests/_ai/door_view_probe.gd")`. The behaviour they assert is
## `docs/tactical-entry.md` E15 / E18 (issue #51, R1 to R3, R9): a walk the entry guard covers stays
## out of the VIEW of every doorway into a room not clear for passing, else secures the doorway from
## beside the jamb and crosses the view in one go.
##
## The view is the test's own copy of the rule, so the spec isn't read back from the code under
## test: the area outside the doorway seen from inside its room through it, bounded by the rays from
## the room's two far corners through the opposite jambs, out to `DEPTH` px along each ray, and
## stopped at walls (a point counts only with a clear line past the walls to the doorway). Furniture
## does not stop the view. A doorway is given as an `entry_probe.gd` frame:
## `{ id, pos, width, out, room }` (`out` the unit normal away from the room).

const Entry := preload("res://tests/_ai/entry_probe.gd")
## `door_view_depth`: how far (px) the view reaches out of the doorway, along its edge rays.
const DEPTH := 450.0
## `door_avoid_ratio` / `door_avoid_slack`: a route round the views is taken when it is no longer
## than this many times the plain route plus this many px.
const AVOID_RATIO := 2.0
const AVOID_SLACK := 300.0
## `tuning.entry_guard.pass_clear_time`: how long (s) a cleared room counts as safe to walk past.
const PASS_CLEAR_TIME := 60.0
## How far (px) inside the view's edge a body's centre must be before it counts as in the view: the
## agent cuts a path's corners by up to 16 px, so a walk that keeps to the edge is not taken for one
## that crosses it.
