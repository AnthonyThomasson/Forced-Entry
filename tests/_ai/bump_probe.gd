## Shared helpers for the tests of NPCs walking into each other (issue #53; not a test itself). It
## watches a set of characters every physics frame and records each time one WALKS INTO another,
## read only off the character's public state: its `global_position`, its `movement.move_input`
## (what its controller is steering it to do) and `is_dead`, plus the NPC brain's public
## `debug_entry()` / `current_act()` to say what each was doing.
##
## "Walks into", measurably: the walker is steering (`movement.move_input` set) toward the other
## body, within `INTO_CONE` of the line between their centres, while the two bodies touch (centres
## closer than two body radii plus `CONTACT_TOL`). Two 14 px circles touch at 28 px and the
## colliders never let them overlap much further, so a few px of tolerance catches the frames they
## press together, while a walk that passes alongside (heading off the line between them) does not
## count. The frames of one ordered pair make one bump, and a contact that resumes within
## `MERGE_GAP` s (a walker that presses, is pushed back a pixel, and presses again) is the same
## bump.
##
## Each bump says whether the body walked into was AT REST (not steering: `movement.move_input`
## zero; the kind of body the steering map carves out) or MOVING (steering a walk of its own) when
## the contact began, and how far that body was SHOVED: its displacement over the bump's frames
## while it was not steering, which only the walker's push can cause.

## Body radius (px) of every character (`Character.radius`).
