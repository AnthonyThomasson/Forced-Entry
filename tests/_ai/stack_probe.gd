## Shared helpers for the tests of the player's place in an AI stack
## (tests/ai/stack/stack_*_test.gd; not a test itself). The behaviour they assert is ticket #41 /
## `docs/tactical-entry.md` E16: a human invader near a doorway an AI team is stacking at is given
## the first free slot over the radio, shown on the floor, and counts in the team's barrier.
##
## A puppet stands in for the human. What Main gives the human is
## `PlayerStack.attach(character, rooms, openings)` (the `PlayerStack` script is loaded by path, so
## a missing script fails the test cleanly instead of a parse error). The stack is read only through
## its public `view()`; the team through the same radio callouts the NPCs hear.
