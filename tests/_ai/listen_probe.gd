## Shared helpers for the listen-at-the-stack tests (tests/ai/grenade/quiet_entry_listen_*; not a
## test itself): `const Listen := preload("res://tests/_ai/listen_probe.gd")`. The behaviour they
## assert is `docs/tactical-entry.md` E17 as amended by issue #51 R17: a quiet entry whose stack
## carries a stun holds `entry_listen_time` (3 s) at the stack before the point starts the pie, so a
## late reason (R11) can arrive; a hostile in view or coming under fire ends the hold; a stack
## without a stun does not hold.
##
## The world is the bang-fallback tests' (tests/_ai/bang_probe.gd): the bare Terrace house, a stack
## of two invaders north-east of the back door, each armed with one stun at the start of `run` (the
## way Main arms a spawn), and scripted Von: SEARCH > ENTER (quiet) > the back door. Nothing makes
## the kitchen suspect. The point is the member whose claim holds slot 1; it is "holding" while its
## order is still that ENTER and its entry is in the `stack` phase.
