## Shared helpers for the suspect-room STUN ENTRY tests (tests/ai/grenade/stun_entry_*; not a test
## itself): `const Suspect := preload("res://tests/_ai/suspect_probe.gd")`. The behaviour they
## assert is `docs/grenades.md` G18 as amended by issue #51 (R6): besides gunfire heard there and a
## hostile seen going in, a room is suspect when an ally radioed a hostile or a fight in it, the NPC
## was shot at from it, a hostile was lost near its doorway or heading in, or footsteps were heard
## there; a stack that carries a stun then takes STUN ENTRY into it, and quiet ENTER where nothing
## makes it suspect (`quiet_entry_unsuspected_room`).
##
## The world is `stun_entry_suspect_room`'s: the bare Terrace house and a stack of two invaders in
## the back garden, both armed with one stun at the start of `run` (the test world keeps the default
## inventory; this is how Main arms a spawn). Each test adds the one thing that makes the kitchen
## suspect, first thing in `run` so it is in the stack's first decision.
