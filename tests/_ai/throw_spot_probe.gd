## Shared helpers for the throw-spot tests (tests/ai/grenade/grenade_throw_spot_*,
## grenade_walks_to_throw_spot, grenade_shots_origin_throw_spot; not a test itself):
## `const Spot := preload("res://tests/_ai/throw_spot_probe.gd")`. The behaviour they assert is
## `docs/grenades.md` G17: GRENADE is also offered when the hostile (or the shots' origin) is out of
## range or has no clear lob from where the NPC stands, if a reachable throw spot exists (a point on
## the navmesh within the grenade's range of the spot, with a clear lob, a short walk away); the
## `throw` primitive walks there first, then throws, and the ally-in-blast and self-safety tags are
## judged from the throw spot.
##
## The read-out the tests rely on (reached duck-typed): the controller's `debug_zones()` lists every
## `grenade_throws` option of the last snapshot (the bound hostile's and the shots' one, dropped
## ones included) as a zone of category `grenade`, with `point` (where the grenade is to burst),
## `from` (the throw spot: where it throws from, its own position when it throws from where it
## stands) and `tags` (`ally_in_blast`, `no_safe_spot`, judged with the thrower at `from`).
