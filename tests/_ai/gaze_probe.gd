## Shared helpers for the gaze-and-fire tests (tests/ai/gaze/ and friends; not a test itself). The
## behaviour they assert is `docs/gaze-and-fire.md`: an NPC is always either looking at (and, when
## it can, shooting) a threat, or watching doors, never a wall and never with its back to a known
## threat. The geometry here is the test's own (door points, a ray along the facing), not read back
## from the code under test.
