## Ticket #61 R10 (the Lighting domain): the shared reads of the `tests/lighting/` tests. Not a
## test.
##
## The plan's numbers are kept here as consts, so a test checks the plan and not the code.
##
## What the tests read (each test names the ones it uses):
## - `WorldLighting` (class_name, `scenes/lighting/`): the world's lighting node, built by Main and
##   the Testing world under the world root and in the group `world_lighting`, with
##   - `lights() -> Array`: every PointLight2D it gave a piece or a room fixture (not the flashes);
##   - `fixtures() -> Array`: `{ room, light }` per room fixture (`room` the `WorldGen.get_rooms`
##     key, `light` its PointLight2D);
##   - `flashes() -> Array`: the pooled PointLight2Ds the `shot` / `explosion` flashes are lit with;
##   - `budget() -> Dictionary`: `{ per_floor, dropped }`, `per_floor` the most piece and fixture
##     lights one floor may be reached by, `dropped` `{ piece, index }` per declared light the
##     budget left without a PointLight2D (`index` into its `get_lights()`);
##   - `static light(root: Node2D, seed_value: int, rooms := []) -> WorldLighting`: light the world
##     under `root` (`rooms` the `WorldGen.get_rooms` dicts, for the fixtures; the call Main and the
##     Testing world make).
## - `LightingConfig` (class_name static holder): `ambient_color`, `sky_color` and `enabled` (the
##   `lighting.enabled` switch).
## - On a piece that gives light (Objects): `get_lights() -> Array`, one plain dict per light
##   (`offset`, `colour`, `energy`, `radius`, `shape`, `rhythm`, `room_light`: true when it lights
##   its room, so the room needs no fixture, and `height`: `overhead` or `low`), read duck-typed.
## - A light's pool is its texture: a radial GradientTexture2D, read through its `gradient`
##   (`profile`).
## - Occluders, flashes, the ambient and the sky are plain Godot nodes (LightOccluder2D,
##   PointLight2D, CanvasModulate, DirectionalLight2D) under the test world, read by their own
##   properties.
