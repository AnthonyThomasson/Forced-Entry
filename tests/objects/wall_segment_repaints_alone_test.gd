extends GameTest
## Each segment of a wall is drawn by its own child of the wall's visuals (wall_visuals.gd), in
## segment order, so a hit repaints the struck segment alone (its dent and marks) while the rest
## keep their drawing. This shoots one segment of an arena's walls and counts each segment's draws:
## the struck one draws again, no other does, and every segment has its drawing child in order.
