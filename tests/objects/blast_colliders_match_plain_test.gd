## A frag dents a room's worth of furniture in one frame, and each dented piece rebuilds its
## collider from convex pieces of its silhouette in a deferred call (environment_object.gd). The
## first rebuild of a flush cuts every waiting piece's silhouette together on the worker threads
## (`ColliderCuts`); each piece still swaps its own colliders in its own call. This checks that
## after a frag and its fragments every piece's collider is exactly what cutting its own silhouette
## alone gives (`Deformation.convex_pieces`), piece by piece and point by point.
