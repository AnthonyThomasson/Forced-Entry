## A piece's drop shadow falls a fixed way in the world, away from the light, however the piece is
## turned (environment_object_visuals.gd). It is drawn behind the piece by the visuals' `DropShadow`
## child, in the piece's own frame, and a turn moves that child to the shadow's offset rather than
## repainting the piece. This checks the shadow lies `coverage x drop_shadow_per_coverage` px
## (capped at `drop_shadow_max`) from the piece, straight away from the light, at several turns, the
## frame after each, and that the child draws behind the piece.
