## A wall struck several times in one frame (a frag's fragments) rebuilds each struck segment's
## collider once, from the dents as they stand when the deferred rebuild runs, as a piece of
## furniture does (wall.gd); and the dented segment polygon is kept between asks
## (`Deformation.wall_polygon`), as a wall repaints every segment whenever one is struck. This
## checks that after volleys of hits landing in one frame each segment's collider is exactly the
## convex cut of its dented polygon, that the kept polygon is the one a fresh computation gives (and
## a fresh array each ask), and that a further dent gives a new one.
