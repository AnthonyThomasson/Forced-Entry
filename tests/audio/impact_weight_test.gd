## Impacts have weight. Whatever a round hits, even something hard that rings (metal, glass,
## ceramic), most of the sound is a low thump rather than a thin ring, and a heavier round lands
## harder than a lighter one: its low-end energy, counting its louder level, grows light -> medium
## -> heavy on every material for a round that stops in it and one that goes through. So an SMG
## round is lighter than a pistol round, which is lighter than a rifle's.
