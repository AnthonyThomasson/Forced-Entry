## How the Sound service plays: a category never has more voices sounding than its cap (the oldest
## is cut off for the newest), voices free themselves when their clip is done, repeated events vary
## but never repeat a variant back to back, the same events after a reset play the same way, and
## none of it touches the gameplay RNG (a seeded `randf()` is unmoved by a burst of sounds). Range
## is checked on the pure function the service uses for it: a view centred somewhere, at some zoom.
