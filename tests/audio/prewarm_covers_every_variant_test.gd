## The sound service pre-renders its library in the background so no sound hitches the first time it
## plays. A variant nobody had rendered was synthesized in the middle of the first fight (a frame or
## three lost per new variant), so the pre-warm list holds every variant of every profile, the first
## variant of each ahead of the rest.
