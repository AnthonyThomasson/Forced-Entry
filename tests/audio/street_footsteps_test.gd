## R6 (ticket #61): the outdoor ring round a generated house is drawn as street and sidewalk, and it
## registers no sound surface, so footsteps outside still sound like the open ground. A puppet walks
## out of the front door and down the front of the house: every step there plays the `outdoor`
## footstep. Then the street itself: the house has street and sidewalk pieces, drawn in the house,
## outside every room, ringing the house on all sides, under the walk just taken, and none of them
## is a sound surface.
##
## It reads the street through `WorldGen.get_street(house) -> Array` (interface 1, like
## `get_rooms`), of `{ kind, rect, node }`, one entry per piece of the ring: `kind` `street` or
## `sidewalk`, `rect` its world rect, `node` the node that draws it.
