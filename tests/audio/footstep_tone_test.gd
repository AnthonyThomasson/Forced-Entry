## Footsteps are dull thuds, never tinny. Every take of every surface's walk and run keeps its
## energy low: the sample-to-sample change over the energy (brightness) stays far under what hiss,
## clicks or a high ring produce, and most of its energy sits below ~300 Hz. Different floors may
## sound alike; they may not sound sharp.
