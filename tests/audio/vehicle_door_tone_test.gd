## V7 / F2 (ticket #54, feedback round 1): a vehicle's door sounds sit in a reload's register:
## lower-pitched and mechanical (clicks, the latch, a thunk), no high creak or ring. Every take of
## every `door/<kind>/<stage>` profile is no brighter than the brightest take of the guns' reloads
## (`reload/<gun>/<out|in>`, measured here, not copied), and keeps most of its energy low, as the
## footstep and impact tone tests measure it.

const Probe := preload("res://tests/_audio/sound_probe.gd")
## Most of a door take's energy sits under this many Hz (the footstep tone test's band)...
const LOW_HZ := 300.0
## ... more than this share of it: a creak or a panel ring above ~300 Hz pulls a take under it, and
## footsteps and impacts measure ~0.83. The doors' brightness sits far under the reloads' clicks, so
## that ceiling is a guard, and this share is what pins the register.
const LOW_FLOOR := 0.75
