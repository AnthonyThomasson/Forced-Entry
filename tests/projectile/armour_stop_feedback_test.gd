## O6 (docs/outfits.md): what a stopped round looks and sounds like. A round stopped by armour
## leaves no wound (no dent: `damage_taken()` stays put), no blood and no exit, still hurts a little
## (the armour's blunt share), and its `&"hit"` event carries the armour's material, which is what
## the impact is heard as: a steel plate rings as metal, a ceramic plate as ceramic, the helmet as
## its composite, the soft vest as its own fabric, never as flesh. A bare body shot the same way
## bleeds, is dented and is heard as flesh. One round at a time, so each one's blood can be counted.
