## O8 (docs/outfits.md): a plate's condition starts at 1 and is worn by every hit it takes (damage /
## durability), and its stop power falls toward the soft panel's as it wears. A ceramic IV plate
## wears fast: it stops the first rifle round but yields after a few. A steel III plate barely wears
## and stops every one of the same rifle rounds. `outfit_view()` shows each plate's condition. Rifle
## rounds, one at a time, into the front plate of two carriers facing the shooter.

const OutfitProbe := preload("res://tests/_outfit/outfit_probe.gd")
const TORSO := 40.0
## Rifle rounds fired at each plate; the ceramic one yields within them, the steel one holds through
## all.
