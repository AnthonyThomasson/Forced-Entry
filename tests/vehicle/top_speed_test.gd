## V5 / F7 (ticket #54, feedback round 3): top speeds a driver really reaches. The car's top speed
## is 1280 px/s (about 92 km/h at ~50 px/m) and the van's 880 px/s (the plan's numbers, not
## VehicleConfig's). A car and a van, each with a driver, hold full throttle
## down a long straight: each reaches at least 95% of its top speed and never goes more than 2% past
## it (held on for a few seconds once there, to see where it settles). The launch and the brakes are
## `vehicle/launch_and_brake`.

## Long enough for the car to reach 95% of 1280 px/s (about 2000 px at the plan's launch), hold it 3
## s (3840 px) and still lift off before BRAKE_BEFORE_WALL.
