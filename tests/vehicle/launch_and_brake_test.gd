## V5 / F4, F7 (ticket #54, feedback rounds 2 and 3): an arcade-punchy launch and brakes to match.
## On full throttle from rest the car reaches 640 px/s (half its 1280 top) within 1.1 s and the van
## 440 px/s (half its 880 top) within 1.4 s; from its top speed S stops the car within 2.0 s and the
## van within 2.5 s (about as long as the launch to it). The plan's numbers, not VehicleConfig's.
##
## Four vehicles, one driver each, in lanes of their own. Two launch from rest. The other two are
## set rolling at the plan's top speed straight ahead (through `linear_velocity`, as
## `vehicle/hits_character_damage_by_speed` sets an empty car going) and braked at once: the brake
## check then measures the brakes alone, not whether the engine gets there (that is
## `vehicle/top_speed`).
