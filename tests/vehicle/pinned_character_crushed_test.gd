## V6 / F6 (ticket #54, feedback round 2): a character with something solid at it is still hurt, and
## the car slows naturally: it is never stopped dead by a character. Four empty cars are let roll at
## the same 200 px/s (between harm_min_speed 90 and harm_kill_speed 300: hurt, not killed, in the
## open) at a standing character:
##  (a) pinned: the character stands just in front of a heavy armchair (the chair right behind it,
##  along the car's path); (b) pinned: the character stands just in front of the arena wall;
##  (c) in the open, nothing behind it (the yardstick, as in
##  `vehicle/hits_character_damage_by_speed`); (d) shielded: the armchair stands between the car and
##  the character, which stands right behind it.
## (a) and (b) take at least the open hit's harm; (d) at least half of it (the piece carries the
## blow on, some of it absorbed). Against the armchair (a, d) the car shoves the piece on and keeps
## a natural share of its speed; in the open it keeps most of it; against the wall (b) it stops as a
## wall crash does, and posts a crash.
##
## The thresholds, from the physics (masses: car 400, character 40, armchair made heavy: 80):
##  - Harm: the open hit's closing speed is the car's 200 px/s (the character stands still), and so
##    is the first touch in (a) and (b), so equal harm is the floor; DAMAGE_SLACK only absorbs a
##    frame's sampling of the closing speed (2% of the damage, under 1 px/s of it). In (d) the
##    chair, shoved at nearly the car's speed, strikes the character; half the open harm leaves room
##    for what the piece absorbs and is far from none.
##  - Speed kept 0.1 s after the first touch. Open (c): the character takes its momentum share (40 /
##    440) with a bounce (harm_bounce 0.4), so the car keeps 1 - 1.4 x 40 / 440 = 87%, less rolling
##         resistance (25 px/s², about 1%): 70%
##    leaves room for a frame's contact and is far from a stop. Armchair (a, d): car, character and
##    chair shoved as one plastic pile keep 400 / 520 = 77% by momentum; the character's bounce
##    takes about 6% more and the chair's damping (4 /s on 80 of 520) under 1% in 0.1 s, so about
##    70% is natural; (a) asks for 30% (the plan's floor: the pinned character is squeezed and the
##    chair turns), (d) for 50% (the chair alone takes the first blow).
