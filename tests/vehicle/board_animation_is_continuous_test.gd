## V3 (ticket #54): boarding is one fluid movement, never a jump. Sampled every frame from the E
## press until the door has shut behind the seated character: the character's position never steps
## further in a frame than its own walk does, its facing turns smoothly (toward the door, then
## forward), the door eases open before the character folds in and eases shut after, the fold eases
## from standing to seated, and the seated character ends drawn over the chassis and under the roof.

const Probe := preload("res://tests/_vehicle/vehicle_probe.gd")
## The most the facing may turn in one frame (rad): 15 rad/s, a half turn in no less than 0.2 s.
const MAX_TURN_PER_FRAME := 0.25
## The most the fold may change in one frame: a 0.5 s eased fold peaks near 0.05.
const MAX_FOLD_PER_FRAME := 0.1
## The most a door's open amount may change in one frame: a 0.35 s eased swing peaks near 0.08.
const MAX_DOOR_PER_FRAME := 0.15
## A measured ease (the door from 5 % to 90 % open, the fold from 10 % to 90 %) takes between these
## shares of the spec's full time (`Probe.DOOR_OPEN_TIME`, `Probe.FOLD_TIME`).
