## V1 (ticket #54): E boards by the door whose handle is nearest the character, among those within
## reach (60 px). A character standing just out of the front-left door, with the rear-left handle
## also in reach, gets in at the front left and takes the driver's seat; one at the rear right gets
## in there and takes the rear-right seat. Only the chosen door opens.
