## V1 (ticket #54): a door that cannot open is skipped for the next nearest that can. The car is
## parked in the open with an armchair standing just off its left side, in the rear-left door's
## swing, so that door cannot open. A character on the car's left side between the rear-left and
## front-left handles, nearer the rear-left, with both in reach: E boards by the front-left door
## into the driver's seat, and the rear-left door never opens.
