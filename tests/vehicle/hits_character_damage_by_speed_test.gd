## V6 (ticket #54): a character struck by a vehicle is knocked back, and hurt by the closing speed
## above harm_min_speed (90 px/s), up to lethal at harm_kill_speed. Three empty cars are let roll
## into three standing characters: at 60 px/s the character is shoved and unhurt, between the two
## speeds it is hurt and lives, above harm_kill_speed it dies.
