extends GameTest
## Keybinds is the single place an input's binding lives: `bind` takes a key or a mouse button (and
## refuses anything else), `overrides` reports only what differs from the defaults,
## `apply_overrides` reads that back tolerantly, `reset` restores, and `conflicts_of` flags two
## actions on one input — except the Interact/Pause pair that deliberately shares Space.
