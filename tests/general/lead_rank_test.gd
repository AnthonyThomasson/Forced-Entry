## LD10 (`docs/leadership.md`): "Lead the team". With it on (the setup window's `lead`, Start only),
## the human leads, and a human invader is given rank 2: the first NPC invader becomes the sergeant
## (1) and the rest troopers (0). The style draws are unchanged (each character's style and look
## seed are the ones it gets with "Lead the team" off). With it off, the human is ranked last of the
## unit. `Settings.set_setup` saves the config's `lead` with the rest of the window's choices.
##
## The window's config is read into a match spec as Main reads it (`MatchBuilder.spec_from_setup`,
## over a base naming the human), then the combatants are armed by it (`MatchBuilder.arm`) in a
## match's order (the NPCs, then the human). `Settings.path` points at a scratch file, so no
## developer's file is touched.
