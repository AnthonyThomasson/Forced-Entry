## Main drops an NPC without launching the furniture it lands beside. The spawner used to add the
## NPC to the tree at the world origin and only then move it, so for that moment its collider
## overlapped any piece standing near (0, 0); the physics ejected the piece at thousands of px/s,
## and it flew across the map into whatever character was in its way (a "character spawns or is
## pushed way far away from the level"). House seed 18 with the front entrance at the game's (440,
## 350) puts a kitchen counter against the origin. The match is populated over the test's house as
## Main populates one (`s.declared_match`, `MatchBuilder.populate`): one defender and one invader,
## placed from the house seed.
