## R2 and R3's arming (ticket #61): Main arms a match's crew from the match seed (`_arm_characters`,
## as `match_setup_test` drives it, on a Main that never enters the tree), and the styles come with
## the arms:
## - R2: every invader, the human invader too, wears one police unit (`Character.style` `zenitex` or
##   `trauma`), the same for every invader of a match; the unit is drawn from the seed (re-arming
##   with the same seed gives the same one, and across seeds both units come up). Each defender is
##   seeded to `merc` or `borg` (both in a crew of twelve) and to a look seed of its own.
## - R3 (`LoadoutConfig.apply` hands each item the wielder's weapon style): an invader's gun and
##   grenades are `police` issue; a defender's are `scrap` or `pipe`, one style for all it carries,
##   and both come up across the crew.
## - The unit's ranks (`docs/outfits.md`, styles): its first invader is the lead (`Character.rank`
##   2), the second the sergeant (1), the rest troopers (0); a defender has no rank.
## Read through `Character.style` / `look_seed` / `rank` and each carried gun's and grenade's
## `Item.style`.
