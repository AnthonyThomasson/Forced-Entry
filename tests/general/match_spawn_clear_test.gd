## Main drops defenders where they can stand: never inside a solid piece of furniture and never on
## top of another defender. World-gen puts a free-standing piece (a bed, an island, a table) at a
## room's dead centre first, so a defender dropped at the centre would spawn inside it, and the
## first physics step would eject the piece, which hands its momentum back and flings the defender
## across the map. A unit test of the placement rule inside the match module: it
## runs the match spawner (`match_spawner.gd`, which `MatchBuilder.populate` places every match's
## NPCs through) on the test's own world, into the one room the test picks, which no match spec can
## pin.
