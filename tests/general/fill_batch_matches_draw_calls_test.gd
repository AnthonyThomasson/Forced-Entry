## General's `FillBatch` draws plain-coloured polygons and discs as one triangle array where
## `draw_colored_polygon` and `draw_circle` drew one command each (the body's limbs and shadow,
## blood splats, resting chips, blood prints, wound marks). Headless (the suite) this checks what it
## hands the renderer: the triangles `Geometry2D.triangulate_polygon` cuts each polygon into, every
## disc as `draw_circle`'s 64-gon and every convex polygon given as such fanned from its first
## corner, each in its colour, in the order added (batching forced on, as it is with a window), and
## that under the headless display a batch hands each shape to its canvas as it comes and holds
## nothing. Run with a window (`tools/run_tests.sh --windowed
## --id=general/fill_batch_matches_draw_calls`) it also renders the same overlapping, half
## transparent shapes both ways, magnified, and checks every pixel is the same.
