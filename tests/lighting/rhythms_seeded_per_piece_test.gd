## R10 (ticket #61): light rhythms (steady / buzz / failing / blink / shimmer / pulse) are seeded
## per piece. The same room, four TVs, four neon tubes and two lamps, is built twice, each copy in a
## world of its own (a SubViewport with its own World2D, so the copies stand at the same coordinates
## without touching), and each is lit with the same seed in the same frame. Over four seconds every
## light of one copy has exactly the same energy, frame by frame, as its twin in the other (two
## runs, same seed, same rhythm), and within one copy no two lights that change over time change
## alike (different pieces differ).
##
## It reads `WorldLighting.light(root, seed_value) -> WorldLighting` (how Main and the Testing world
## light a world) and its `lights()`. Light energy is the PointLight2D's own (0 while disabled).
