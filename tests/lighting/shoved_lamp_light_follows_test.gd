## R10 (ticket #61): a shoved lamp's light moves with it. A lamp is shoved across the room (the
## pushable contract's `apply_impulse`): while it slides and once it rests, each of its lights stays
## where it was in the lamp's own frame, and is still one of the lighting's lights.
##
## It reads (tests/_lighting/lighting_probe.gd) `WorldLighting` in the group `world_lighting`
## with `lights()`; the lamp's `get_lights()`.

const Probe := preload("res://tests/_lighting/lighting_probe.gd")

## px the shove must carry the lamp, so the light has somewhere to follow it to.
const MOVED := 40.0
## px a light may stray from its place on the lamp.
