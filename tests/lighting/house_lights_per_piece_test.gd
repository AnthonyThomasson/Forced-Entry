## R10 (ticket #61): a generated house is lit by its pieces. Every light-giving piece (lamps,
## screens, neon tubes, streetlights) declares its lights (`get_lights()`), and the lighting gives
## each declared light a PointLight2D parented to the piece (so it moves with it), unless the floor
## budget dropped it; a room with no piece of its own lighting it gets a ceiling fixture. No floor
## is reached by more than 12 of those lights, so with the 3 flashes no floor's canvas item has more
## than the 15 point lights Godot 4.4 lights an item with.
##
## It reads (tests/_lighting/lighting_probe.gd) `WorldLighting` in the group `world_lighting`
## with `lights()`, `fixtures()`, `flashes()` and `budget()`; a light-giving piece's `get_lights()`
## with `room_light` on the light that lights its room.
