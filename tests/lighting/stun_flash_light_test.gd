## S8 (ticket #56, `docs/lighting.md` L9): a stun's burst is shown by the lighting. A puppet throws
## a stun into the open; at the burst one of the lighting's flash lights is lit where it went off,
## white, shadowed like every flash, and bright: a peak energy of at least 4.8, well over a frag's
## flash (2.6). It holds its full brightness for an instant, is still lit half a second after the
## burst and is dark within about a second. (That no drawn white disc goes with it is
## `physics/explosion_fx`.)
##
## The exact brightness and hold are the build's to set: the test asserts the shape (held, then
## faded inside ~1 s, a peak of at least 4.8), read off `WorldLighting.flashes()`
## (tests/_lighting/lighting_probe.gd).
