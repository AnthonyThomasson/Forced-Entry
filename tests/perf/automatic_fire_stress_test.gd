## Performance guard: four SMGs and four rifles hold the trigger for five seconds into a furnished
## arena — the sustained rate of an automatic gun (13 and 9 rounds a second each), spread and all —
## while four pistols click off a round every fourth frame. Every round runs the ballistic
## resolution (the rifle's goes on through what it hits), dents furniture, sprays debris and drops a
## casing. Frame cost stays within budget, the Despawner cap holds, the pistols' rounds really land,
## and once the firing ends the world does not keep growing.

# first ~50 frames only; the automatic guns carry the rest.) Each tracked chip carries a visuals
# child, so a full Despawner (1000) is ~2000 nodes; baseline ~2200.
