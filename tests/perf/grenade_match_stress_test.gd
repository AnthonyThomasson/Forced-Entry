## P1 (`docs/grenades.md`, Performance): grenades going off in a running match keep it smooth. The
## 5v5 match of `perf/match_5v5_stress` (a generated house, its largest plan, Main's placement and
## loadouts, nav re-baker, blood, debris, sound and radio on, scripted Von), and once the sides are
## in contact a puppet on the invaders' side (the human's place) throws three frags and three stuns
## among the fighters over about 3 s, through the controller contract (select the slot, aim, click).
## So the burst's whole cost is in the window: the blast and its fragments, the flash and bang, the
## FX, scorch, blood and debris, the sounds, and every NPC's grenade perception, evade planning and
## re-decision. From the first throw to 3 s after the last burst the frames meet the smooth standard
## (`Perf.SMOOTH_*`). The camera frames the fighters as Main's spectator view does, on a player's
## screen, so every body a player would see is drawn. Headless measures the CPU only (the drawing
## calls included, not the GPU); `tools/run_tests.sh --windowed` measures the render too.
