## P2 (`docs/grenades.md`, Performance): a frag and a stun going off together in a crowded,
## furnished room keep the frame smooth. Twelve pieces of furniture and eight characters stand round
## the middle of an arena, blood, debris, hit particles and sound on; a puppet throws a frag into
## the middle and then a stun timed to go off with it (through the controller contract: select the
## slot, aim, click). The blast and its fragments, the flash and bang, the FX, scorch, blood,
## debris, ragdolls and sounds all land in one frame and the two seconds after it, and those frames
## meet the smooth standard (`Perf.SMOOTH_*`). The runner's camera frames every actor on a player's
## screen, so every body is drawn. Headless measures the CPU only (the drawing calls included, not
## the GPU); `tools/run_tests.sh --windowed` measures the render too.
