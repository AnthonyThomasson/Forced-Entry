## Performance guard for the largest match the game means to carry: a 10v10 in a generated house
## (the largest plan, `PLAN`), set up the way Main sets one up (the match spawner's placement, every
## NPC armed from the default random loadout, nav re-baker, blood, debris, sound and team radio all
## on) with Von scripted so no server is needed. After a warm-up that brings the sides into contact,
## 300 frames are measured to the same standard as the 5v5 match: the average frame fits in one 60
## fps frame, with no spike over two. Twenty NPCs sense, decide, path and fight; the house's walls
## hide most hostiles from each, which is what keeps it within reach of the standard where an open
## arena of twenty is not (perf/npc_crowd_stress). Headless measures CPU only; rendering is not in
## these numbers.

## than drawn from the seed: the match is measured in a full-size house whatever the catalogue
## holds, and a plan added or dropped changes no seed's load. A small flat would put both sides in
## each other's sight from the start, which is a different load.
