## `PixelArt.render_turned` shares one texture between calls that mean the same art, however their
## arguments were built: equal values passed as new objects, and an angle that differs below the
## four decimals the cache key keeps. A different colour, material, option or angle is a different
## texture, and an options dictionary changed after the call does not change what was cached.
