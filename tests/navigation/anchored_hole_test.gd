## R8 (ticket #61): an anchored solid piece (a definition with `anchored: true`, spawned through
## ObjectFactory) never moves, and it is still an obstacle: `NavBuilder.furniture_holes` (interface
## 9) includes its footprint and the baked map has a hole there, like any solid furniture. A plain
##    chair beside it is carved as before, and a walk-over rug
## (non-solid decor, frozen too) is still not carved: the build carves the anchored pieces, not
## every frozen body.
