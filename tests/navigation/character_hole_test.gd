## A living character at rest is carved out of the steering map like a piece of furniture: a path
## across the arena detours around a puppet standing on the straight line, the hole goes when it
## walks off (a walker leaves none), and a character that dies leaves no hole behind (a corpse is
## walked over). The world's own map, which the AI plans with, never has the characters in it.
