## A re-bake still in flight when its region is freed (a world torn down mid-bake: a test ending, a
## match restarting) lands quietly: `NavBuilder.rebake_async` leaves the freed region alone and
## still calls `done`, with no engine error (a callback that held the freed region logged one into
## whatever ran next).
