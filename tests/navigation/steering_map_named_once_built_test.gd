## Interface 9: `NavBuilder.steering_map(planning_map)` names the steering map as soon as `build`
## has returned, before the map has synchronized. Main bakes a match's navmesh and drops the NPCs in
## within the same frame, and each NPC's locomotion asks for the steering map as it is set up; a map
## named only after its first sync left every NPC of a match on the plain map for good (issue #53:
## an AI stopped short of a body at rest it could have walked round, and waited). Until the map has
## synchronized `NavBuilder.ready` says so, and that is the only rule for "not yet".
##
## The house is built in a world of its own (a `SubViewport` with a fresh `World2D`), so its maps
## are new, as a match's are.
