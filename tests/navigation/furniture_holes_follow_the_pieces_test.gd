## `NavBuilder.furniture_holes` keeps each piece's footprint hull with what it was made from (each
## collision shape's global transform and its size, radius or points) and makes it again only when
## that changes, and finds the pieces with `find_children` where it once walked every node itself.
## This pins it to a fresh measurement: the same holes, in the same order, over a generated house as
## it stands, after pieces are moved and turned, and after a piece is shot up (its collider rebuilt
## in convex pieces), and a moved piece's hole moves with it.
