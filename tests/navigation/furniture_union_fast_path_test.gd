## The nav re-bake fuses overlapping furniture footprints into one hole each
## (`NavBuilder._union_outlines`). That is the costliest step of a re-bake (it ran a polygon merge
## for every pair of footprints), so it skips the merge for two footprints whose bounding boxes are
## apart: the union of such a pair is the pair, as the merge would have said. This pins the result
## to the plain every-pair merge, outline for outline, over sixteen generated houses.
