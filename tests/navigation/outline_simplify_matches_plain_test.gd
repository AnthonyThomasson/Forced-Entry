## A furniture hole's outline drops its vertices within `SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE` of the line between
## their neighbours, nearest first, before the bake (`NavBuilder._simplified`). It keeps each
## vertex's distance where it once measured every vertex again after each drop (dropping one changes
## only its two neighbours'). This pins it to the plain loop, vertex for vertex, over outlines like
## a shot-up piece's on the 1 px grid: shallow curves, steps a pixel deep, runs of points in line.
