extends GameTest
## A turned chair beside a wall cuts the planning navmesh with its hole, and the cut used to leave
## vertices a fraction of a pixel apart: the NavigationServer merges edges by 1 px cell, rejects an
## edge whose ends share one and logs "navigation map synchronization error" (any logged engine
## error fails a test). Only the steering bake welded those vertices
## (`character_beside_wall_bakes_clean`); the planning re-bake, run by the NavUpdater whenever
## furniture is shoved, did not, and tripped once in a while (seen in a run of
## `ai/grenade/stun_entry_suspect_room`, a chair moved by a body beside it). Now every bake welds.
## These are the chair spots a random search of 600 placements found the unwelded planning bake
## wrong at, baked both ways (in place and on the server's worker thread).
