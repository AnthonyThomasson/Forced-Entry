## O12 (docs/outfits.md): every garment changes how the body is drawn, standing and fallen. The
## drawing is read through `Visuals.drawn_art()`: the textures the body's last draw painted (pixel
## art is cached by what it depicts, so the same drawing gives the same textures and a changed part
## a new one).
## - Standing: from plain clothes, putting on a hat, a helmet instead, a shirt instead of the
##   t-shirt, a tactical vest, a plate carrier, tactical pants and boots each paint something the
##   plain body never painted (sampled before and after each one).
## - A worn plate repaints: rifle rounds into a ceramic front plate paint a drawing the new plate
##   never had (its cracks).
## - Crouched (drawn from the same folded trunk as a fallen body): a shirt, tactical pants and a
##   vest each paint something the crouched plain body never painted, and a plate carrier shows on
##   the folded back as well as round the neck (two of its textures are painted in the carrier's
##   colour: the back's and the shoulders').
## - Fallen: a body that died in a plate carrier shows it; with the carrier taken off as it lies its
##   drawing changes, and with the carrier put back its drawing is the one it had in the carrier.
