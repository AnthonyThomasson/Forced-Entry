## A punch shoves furniture at the fist, not at its centre (issue #50). Two fists puppets each punch
## south into the north side of a bench lying east-west, near one end: the bench punched near its
## east end turns clockwise (a positive rotation, the struck end swinging south), the one punched
## near its west end counter-clockwise. Both still slide away.

## A bench is 80 x 30; its long axis lies east-west.
const HALF_DEPTH := 15.0
## How far from the bench's centre each boxer stands along it: 12 px in from an end.
const END_OFFSET := 28.0
## Px between a boxer's centre and the bench's north side (the punch tests' usual reach).
const REACH_GAP := 28.0
const EAST_BENCH := Vector2(250, 200)
const WEST_BENCH := Vector2(550, 200)
## A noticeable turn (degrees).
