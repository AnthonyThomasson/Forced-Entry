## G11 (amended): a flash is stopped by a wall, and by a piece of furniture taller than the
## character only when the character is right against it (within `flash_cover_reach`, 30 px, of the
## piece on the burst's side). A crouched character hunched against a couch (coverage 45, over a
## crouch's 35) between it and the burst is not flashed; one crouched 120 px behind the same kind of
## couch, the couch still on the line from the burst, is: the light comes round and over a piece
## that is not at its face. The victims are stood round the grenade once it lies still, facing it,
## so the blind time is the formula's; one is 175 px from the burst and one 275 px.
