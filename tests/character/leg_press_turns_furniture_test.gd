## A leg pressing a light piece shoves it at the foot or knee, not at its centre (issue #50). Two
## crouched puppets walk slowly south toward the north side of a bench lying east-west, one near its
## east end and one near its west end. A crouch stands the feet ahead of the pelvis with the knees
## leading (standing, a stride reaches only ~1.5 px past the body circle), so the legs reach the
## bench well before the body and, at this pace, keep it ahead of the body: the leg press alone must
## turn the bench the way the pressed end is driven (east end: clockwise, a positive rotation; west
## end: counter-clockwise). Only what happens before the body first touches the bench is judged, so
## the walking push plays no part.

## A bench is 80 x 30; its long axis lies east-west.
