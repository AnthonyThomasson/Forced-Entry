## A falling body's trunk keeps its outline (body_trunk.gd, `_outline`). The outline is
## the union of the hulls of neighbouring cross-sections; seen edge-on those hulls touch only along
## a line and the union can come apart, leaving the torso as one small slice for a single frame as
## the body lands. Shoots several targets so a few real ragdolls land, and checks that no trunk's
## outline area dips below half of both its neighbouring frames' areas. Reads the outline; draws
## nothing.

const TARGETS := 4
## Frames sampled at most after the last target is down: the landing and settling. Sampling stops
## early once every body has come to rest (its outline cannot change any more), but not before
## MIN_FRAMES, which keeps well over 100 sampled frames per target.
