## Interface 7: what a controller may ask of a character about its own body, instead of keeping a
## copy of the numbers: `movement.posture_coverage(posture)` (the height of the body in a posture,
## on the coverage scale `get_surface()` answers for the posture it is in) and
## `movement.run_speed()` (px/s, running standing: what the character really covers, so a controller
## can tell whether it gets somewhere in time). Pinned against what the body does.
