## G12: the bang is reduced (x0.4) through a wall only. A piece of furniture between the burst and a
## character, right against it, stops the flash (G11) but not the sound: a crouched character
## against a couch and a standing one against a wardrobe, both out of the flash, are deafened for
## the full fall-off of their distance. The victims are stood round the grenade once it lies still,
## so the distance is known.
