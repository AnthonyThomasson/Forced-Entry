## A kick wounds the character it reaches for `kick_damage`, once per kick, and posts the same world
## `hit` event a punch does (outcome `punch`, so it sounds like one) with the kicker as attacker,
## and knocks the victim back (the pushable contract). A second kick is refused while one is under
## way.
