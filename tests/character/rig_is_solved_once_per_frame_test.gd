## The character's `anatomy.rig()` solves the standing skeleton once per physics frame and hands
## every caller in that frame the same solve: repeated calls within a frame add no solve and return
## the same joints, a frame in which the body turned gives new joints, and a walking body costs one
## standing solve a frame however often its draw and footsteps ask.
