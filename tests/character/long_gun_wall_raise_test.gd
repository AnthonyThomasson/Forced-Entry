## A long gun is too long for a wall: with its barrel against a wall or object the SMG and the rifle
## are raised, pointing up with the butt still on the shoulder, and cannot fire. The pistol can,
## point-blank. Backing off lowers the gun again and it fires. A person standing in front of the
## barrel is not a wall, and does not stop it.
