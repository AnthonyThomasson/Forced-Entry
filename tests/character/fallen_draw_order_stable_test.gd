## A falling body's parts keep their draw order (character_visuals.gd, `_stack`). A pair of parts
## only swaps over or under each other once their heights differ by more than STACK_BAND; while they
## sit within the band of one another, the order they were drawn in holds, so a limb lying across
## the trunk does not flicker. Shoots a one-hit target and, every frame of its fall, checks that no
## pair swapped while both were within the band. Reads the last drawn order (`_fallen_order`) and
## the parts' heights; draws nothing.
