## Eight puppets each walk into a different piece of furniture from a different side — from the top,
## bottom, left and right and from each corner (diagonals), light pieces to heavy. Every walker's
## real speed must stay steady once it meets its piece: no lunge past walk speed and no sudden
## frame-to-frame snap while it shoves the piece.
