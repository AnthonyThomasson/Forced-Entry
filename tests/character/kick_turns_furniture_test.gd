## A kick shoves furniture at the foot, not at its centre (issue #50). Two puppets each kick south
## into the north side of a sofa lying east-west, near one end: the sofa kicked near its east end
## turns clockwise (a positive rotation, the struck end swinging south), the one kicked near its
## west end counter-clockwise. Both still slide away.

## A sofa is 120 x 50; its long axis lies east-west.
