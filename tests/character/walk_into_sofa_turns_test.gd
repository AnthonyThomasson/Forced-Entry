## Walking into furniture pushes it at the point of contact (issue #50). A puppet walks south into
## the north side of a sofa lying east-west, near its east end: the sofa slides and turns
## noticeably, the pushed (east) end swinging south (clockwise on screen, a positive rotation),
## about a point nearer its far (west) end than the end that was pushed. A second puppet walks into
## the middle of an identical sofa's side: that one just slides, turning by less than 3 degrees.

## How long each puppet walks (s): long enough to shove the 45 kg sofa well along at the pushing
## pace.
