## G3: a thrown grenade does not strike its own thrower as it leaves the hand. It leaves the
## throwing hand beside the body (about 16 px from the body's centre, `docs/grenades.md` G17), and
## its first px pass within body + grenade radius of that centre; standing, the body is above the
## grenade's height there, so a pixel used to decide whether a throw struck its thrower and dropped
## at its feet. Here a stun is let go (`ThrownGrenade.spawn`, the item's own release) 19 px from a
## standing thrower's centre, just outside its body, on a path that passes 13 px from it: it flies
## on past its thrower and comes to rest near its aim, with no bounce near the thrower.

const Probe := preload("res://tests/_ai/grenade_probe.gd")
const AT := Vector2(300, 250)
## 6 px behind the thrower and 18 px to its right as it faces east.
const RELEASE := Vector2(294, 268)
const AIM := Vector2(400, 210)
## A thrown grenade's size against what it strikes (`ThrownGrenade.radius`).
