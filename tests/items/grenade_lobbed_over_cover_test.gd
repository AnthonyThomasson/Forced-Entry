## G2 / G3: a grenade aimed at a spot just behind low cover comes to rest behind it. A lob touches
## down short of its aim and skids the rest of the way, so a sofa standing between the touchdown and
## the aim would stop the skid and kick the grenade back toward the thrower; the throw is lobbed
## farther instead, over the sofa, to touch down past it, and rolls on a little past the aim (as a
## throw aimed past `max_range` does, up to 100 px). A sofa (coverage 45, stood on end across the
## lane) 50 px in front of the aim point: the grenade ends on the far side of it, within that roll
## of the aim.
