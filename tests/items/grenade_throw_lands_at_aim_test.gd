## G2 (and G6, G1's count): a grenade held and clicked is thrown after a 0.3 s wind-up in the
## `throw` stance, leaves the hand toward the aim point, lands within about 40 px of it and goes off
## 3.0 s after release (frag). One grenade is spent per throw (2 -> 1) and the throw posts
## `&"throw"`.
##
## The throw range (G2 as amended by issue #51, R14: `max_range` 550 px for both kinds, so the human
## throws as far too): a frag and then a stun aimed 540 px away land there too, within the same
## scatter, and each reports that range (`Character.inventory.throw_stats`, the number the AI throws
## by). The landing alone does not tell the range: a grenade capped at 450 px skids on to a 540 px
## aim too (the lob fit), so the reported range is what pins it.

const Probe := preload("res://tests/_ai/grenade_probe.gd")
const AIM := Vector2(400, 300)
## How far (px) the landing may be from the aim point (the plan's "about 40 px").
const SCATTER := 45.0
## R14: a throw 540 px out, just inside the 550 px range.
