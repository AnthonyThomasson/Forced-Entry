## S4, S5 (ticket #56, `docs/grenades.md` G13): firing one-handed. While its free hand covers its
## eyes (a blinded character, S1) the weapon hand holds any gun alone
## (`Character.weapon.one_handed()` true), in the `one_hand` stance: the arm out, the gun lower than
## a two-handed grip and wavering; a long gun kicks harder. A round fired one-handed leaves within
## the gun's `spread_deg` plus its `GunConfig` row's `one_hand_spread_deg` (pistol 3, SMG 6, rifle 8
## degrees to start), so wider than two-handed and within that bound. A bang that only deafens
## leaves both hands on the gun. The stun's aim sway is set to 0 here so the spread alone is
## measured (the sway is G13's, `character/stunned_slow_and_sway`).
