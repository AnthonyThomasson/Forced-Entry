## `Deformation.shape_polygon` keeps its last few dented silhouettes, because each hit asks for the
## same one several times (collider, shadow, drawing) and every repaint of a wounded character asks
## again. A kept polygon must be the one a fresh computation gives, for the inputs it was made from
## only: another size, other dents or retuned deformation each get their own.
