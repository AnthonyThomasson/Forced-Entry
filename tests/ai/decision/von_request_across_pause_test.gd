## LD2 (`docs/leadership.md`): a Von request across a pause. The `HTTPRequest` is paused with its
## NPC and so is its own timeout; the answer that arrives during the pause is read on resume and
## adopted then, with no failure (no hold-steady fallback, no transport error logged). The whole
## pipeline runs with the real Von server: a lone invader in the Terrace house's back garden decides
## how to search the house; the moment its first question is in flight the tree is paused for 10 s
## of wall time.
