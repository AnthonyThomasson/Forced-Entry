## LD6 (`docs/leadership.md`): the ORDER node. An arriving order forces a new decision, the entry
## rule `ordered → order` takes the walk to the ORDER node, and its one option (the order) is
## auto-picked: the walk that adopts an order asks Von nothing. Scripted Von logs every question it
## is asked (`t.von_requests()`); an invader in the Terrace house's back garden is ordered to defend
## the kitchen, then given a newer order to defend the living room: each order is adopted by a walk
## of its own, with no question asked from the moment the order is posted.
