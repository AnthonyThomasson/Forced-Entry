## Issue #51 R12 (no needless COMBAT re-decision): adopting an order is not news. The controller
## re-decides at once when its belief about hostiles changes (one spotted, lost or newly hostile, or
## the engaged contact crossing the house boundary: the behaviour's salient key); adopting an order
## that fights a hostile sets the engaged contact, and that alone must not read as a change of
## belief and start a new decision. One mechanism, scripted Von (COMBAT > ENGAGE > from where it
## stands): an invader in an arena with a household puppet in sight from the start, nothing else
## changing. Its first decision is adopted; for the next second no decision is forced by "hostile
## belief changed".
##
## Premises: the puppet cannot be killed and never shoots; the invader stands still (speed 0), so
## where it stands does not change.
