## NPCs that want to decide on the same frame build their decision snapshots over several frames,
## not all in one (`DecisionBudget`): eight invaders spawned together all see a hostile from their
## first frame; at most one of them starts a decision each frame (a choice that is done on arrival,
## like firing from where it stands, is decided again on the next), every one of them has decided
## within two frames apiece (none starves), and with the limit raised to all eight they go on
## deciding together at their cadence.
