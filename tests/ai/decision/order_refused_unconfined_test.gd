## LD6 and LD8 (`docs/leadership.md`): an order the NPC cannot carry out is refused, and the
## decision walk it starts with is its own, not the order's. A `defend_room` order keeps the
## member's fight to options inside that room (`confine_room`); one naming a room the NPC does not
## know is ended `refused` as the walk starts, and that walk is then not confined to the refused
## room: the defender fighting a hostile in its living room still has its living-room firing spots,
## so it engages, with no `confine_room` in the leaf.
##
## Scripted Von (COMBAT, then ENGAGE): a defender in the Terrace house's living room sees an invader
## puppet across the room (unkillable, never shoots). The order is posted straight onto the bus, as
## a squad posts one, naming a room key the house does not have (a squad never produces one: the
## case is the defend spot or room going missing between the order and the walk).
