## LD6 (`docs/leadership.md`): an ordered NPC that is shot at fights (the entry rules
## `under_fire → combat` and `engaged → combat` come before `ordered → order`), and goes back to its
## order once the fight lapses. The whole pipeline runs with the real Von server: a defender in the
## Terrace house's kitchen is ordered by its squad's leader to defend the kitchen; a hostile steps
## up to the back door, fires at it and walks off out of sight.
##
## Premises: the defender and the shooter cannot be killed (the fight must lapse, not end in a
## death); the shooter is an invader puppet (the scripted world event); the order is given through
## the squad as Main wires the leader's command menu to it.

## Just outside the back door, with a line into the kitchen; and well south of it in the garden, out
## of every line from the kitchen.
