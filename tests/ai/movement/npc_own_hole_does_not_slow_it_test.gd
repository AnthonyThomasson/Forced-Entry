## A character is a hole in the steering map and so is the NPC itself, standing inside its own hole
## when it sets off. Its path starts at the nearest open ground, which must not send it off the
## wrong way or make it re-plan every frame: with nobody else around, an NPC advancing across an
## open arena covers the ground as fast as its pace allows and never stalls.
