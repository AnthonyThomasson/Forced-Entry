## Issue #53, one mechanism: an NPC goes round a body at rest that stands on its walk even when the
## way round is a real detour. Two tall rooms share two doorways, a near one and a far one. A
## teammate stands still in the near doorway, in the walker's view. The walker (a defender sent to
## search the far room, scripted Von) takes the far doorway: it never walks into the teammate and
## never moves it. The way round is a real detour, more than 1.5 x the plain walk + 100 px (a walk
## round a body is not capped by its length); the test requires that premise from the walk's real
## destination before it judges, and that the walker SAW the teammate and the steering map had it
## carved out while it was still short of the near doorway (so a pass cannot come from no body being
## there).
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is a puppet that stands still (the body at rest the scenario is
## about) and cannot die; nothing else is changed. Defenders, so the walk is a plain move and not an
## invader's tactical entry.
