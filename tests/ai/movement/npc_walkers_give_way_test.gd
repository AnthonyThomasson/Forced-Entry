## Issue #53, one mechanism: two NPCs walking head-on at each other through the one doorway between
## two rooms, each in the other's view, do not collide. One gives way (it steps aside or waits) and
## the other passes; then both carry on and get where they were going. Neither walks into the other
## at any time ("walks into": `tests/_ai/bump_probe.gd`). The test requires the premise first: both
## were sent across, and they were near the doorway together, coming at each other.
##
## Switches and props: none. Two defenders with scripted Von (search > the other room), so each walk
## is a plain move; each starts facing the doorway (`movement.aim_point`), so they see each other as
## they come.
