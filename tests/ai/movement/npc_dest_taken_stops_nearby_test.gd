## Issue #53, one mechanism: a body standing on the spot an NPC is heading for. An invader (scripted
## Von: ENTER the Terrace house's back door) walks to its stack slot, and a teammate that is not on
## the radio stands on that very spot. The invader does not walk into the teammate or move it; it
## stops short, and ends its walk at a free spot near the slot (`Locomotion`: a body on the
## destination).
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is a puppet that stands still (the body at rest the scenario is
## about), cannot die, and is put on the invader's slot once the invader has chosen it (the slot is
## not known before), while the invader is still out in the garden; nothing else is changed.
