extends GameTest
## Desired: an NPC that reaches the point of a `move` order stands still until it is given a new
## one. Von takes a moment to answer (the first answers of a match are the slowest), and the old
## order must not keep the NPC walking meanwhile: it used to carry on in its last heading, which
## from a point just inside the front door is out of the house. Gunfire is heard just inside the
## front door; a defender in the hall goes to it, and the next answer is slow to come.
