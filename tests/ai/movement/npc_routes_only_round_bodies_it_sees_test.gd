## Issue #53, one mechanism: an NPC's walk accounts for the bodies it SEES, not for every body in
## the world. A room opens by two doorways onto a narrow corridor; the walker (a defender sent to
## search the corridor, scripted Von) is nearer the north doorway, and a teammate stands still in
## the corridor between that doorway and the walker's destination, round the jamb where the walker
## cannot see it from where it starts. Not knowing of the teammate, the walker heads for the north
## doorway, the way it knows to be clear; only once it sees the teammate does it go round (the south
## doorway) or wait. The steering map carves every character at rest, seen or not
## (`NavBuilder.character_holes`), so a walker that went by it alone would turn for the south
## doorway from its first step. The test requires the premises: the teammate seals the corridor and
## is out of the walker's sight at the start, and the way round is a short detour (so a walker
## turning early would be knowing too much, not choosing a cheaper way).
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is a puppet that stands still (the body at rest the scenario is
## about) and cannot die; nothing else is changed. Defenders, so the walk is a plain move and not an
## invader's tactical entry.
