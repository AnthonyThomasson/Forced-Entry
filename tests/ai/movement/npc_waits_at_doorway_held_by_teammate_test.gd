## Issue #53, one mechanism: a teammate standing in the only doorway seals the way, and the walker
## neither shoves it nor presses against it. Two rooms share one doorway; a teammate stands still in
## it, in the walker's view. The walker (a defender sent to search the far room, scripted Von) stops
## short of the teammate, waits a moment, and then re-plans: it takes up another walk (its nav
## target moves off the sealed one) or starts a new decision BECAUSE the way is blocked
## (`debug_state()`: `decisions` grows with `decision_reason` "way blocked", not the decide cadence;
## asked of Von or not, since a level with one option is taken without asking). For the whole watch
## it never walks into the teammate and never moves it. The test requires that the steering map
## really had the doorway sealed when the walker came near, before it judges.
##
## "A moment" is not a number in the spec; the test gives the walker `WAIT_MIN` s still (a stop, not
## a stumble) and `REPLAN_S` s from the stop to re-plan, which a person waiting on a teammate in a
## doorway would not exceed.
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is a puppet that stands still (the body at rest the scenario is
## about) and cannot die; nothing else is changed. Defenders, so the walk is a plain move and not an
## invader's tactical entry.
