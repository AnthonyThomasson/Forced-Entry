## One mechanism (`docs/tactical-entry.md` E18 with the bodies-in-the-way rule of
## `domain-ai-behavior`): a walk that keeps out of a doorway's view still goes round a body at rest
## it knows of, or is held short of it, and never walks into it. The hall of
## `entry_route_round_door_view_inside`: a big hall with a long, narrow store room off its north
## wall, whose doorway's view is a band down the hall that ends short of the south wall. Gunfire is
## heard at the hall's east end; the walk there goes round the far end of the band on the avoid map
## (`way` "doors"). A teammate stands still on that way round, below the band: the walker goes round
## it (by the steering map, or held and re-planned), it does not stand pressed against it, once
## round it it goes back to the avoid map, and it gets to the east end.
##
## Scripted Von (INVESTIGATE, then the one lead, the gunfire): the subject is the walk, not the
## decision. The test requires that the walk was a door-avoiding one and that the walker saw the
## teammate before it got to it.
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is a puppet of the invader side that stands still (the body at
## rest the scenario is about) and cannot die; the gunfire is one shot heard at the hall's east end
## (a `hit` event nobody known fired, as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in
## `run`. Nothing else is changed.
