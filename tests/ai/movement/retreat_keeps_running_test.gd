extends GameTest
## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W6, the exception): an NPC stops sprinting to shoot, but not when
## it is retreating. Falling back from a defender it can see through the living room's door (in
## range, a clear line, a loaded gun) the invader keeps running: a retreat is about getting out of
## the line, not about trading shots.
