## Issue #53 (E16 with E2): the human stands still in its own stack slot, against the wall, and an
## AI teammate comes to the slot nearer the door from the far side of it. The human is in the way
## along the wall, but the open floor out from the wall is free: the AI goes round the human (out
## from the wall and back in), takes its slot and radios `ready`. It never walks into the human or
## moves it, and it never stands still for `STILL_CAP` s or more on the way (a stop short of the
## human, a moment's wait and a new plan within 5 s is the most it may do; it never waits for ever).
##
## The match is built the way `main.gd` builds one (`tests/_ai/match_world_probe.gd`: the house, its
## navmesh and re-baker, then the NPC and the human in the same frame, in a world of its own),
## because a test world waits for its navigation maps before an actor spawns and a match does not.
## The human is the player's character with the player's controller (no input: it stands still) and
## its stack radio as `MatchSpawner.bind_player` gives it. The AI is held where it starts (speed 0)
## until the human stands in its slot: the premise is an AI arriving at a stack the human is already
## in. Scripted Von (ENTER the back door) and the shared entry switches; nothing else changed.
