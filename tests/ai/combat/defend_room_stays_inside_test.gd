## LD8 (`docs/leadership.md`): a member ordered to defend a room fights from inside it. In a fight
## Von still picks the tactic, but only among options inside that room (engage spots, retreat spots,
## flank sides and advance points outside it are dropped), and `fight.hold_ground` /
## `Combat.peek_cover` keep it in the room against a contact outside. The whole pipeline runs with
## the real Von server, in the furnished Terrace house: a defender ordered to defend the kitchen is
## shot at by an intruder standing in the hall just outside the kitchen's doorway, the fight a
## defender would otherwise take into the hall (advance, flank). It fights, and never leaves the
## kitchen. (An unordered defender may go out to it: that is the contrast, not asserted, since "may"
## is Von's call.)
##
## Premises: the defender and the intruder cannot be killed (the fight lasts the whole window); the
## intruder is an invader puppet that fires at the defender once a second (the scripted world
## event); the order is given through the squad, as Main wires the leader's command menu to it.
