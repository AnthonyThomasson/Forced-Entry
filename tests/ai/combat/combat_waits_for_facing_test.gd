## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W2): the fight shoots once the NPC faces its contact, and a peek
## ducks only after a shot. `Combat` is driven here with a stand-in character and perception (no
## world): a peek with the body turned away holds its fire and stays in the peek phase; facing the
## contact it fires and ducks to cover; a shot the gun refuses (a reload under way) keeps it
## peeking; the click of an empty gun ducks (the cover phase reloads); an ambush waits for the
## facing as well.
