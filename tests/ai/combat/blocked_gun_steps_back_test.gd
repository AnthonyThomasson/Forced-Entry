## The AI is not written per weapon: when its gun cannot fire because the barrel is against
## something, it steps back instead. A defender with an assault rifle has a chair against its barrel
## (the chair's edge is between the aim line and the barrel's line, so the line of fire to the
## intruder is clear and only the rifle touches it). Pinned in place (speed 0) it holds fire and
## keeps trying to back away; free to move it steps back, the barrel clears and it shoots the
## intruder.

## The rifle in `GunConfig`: the slot the defender is given.
