## LD8 / D8 (`docs/leadership.md`): a member defending a room and a live grenade. The evade reflex
## runs as it does anywhere and may take it out of the room; once the grenade has burst, the member
## walks back in and holds ("never leaves the room" is a rule on its fight options, not on the
## reflex). A defender ordered to defend the box room (a room 140 px square off a corridor) sees a
## frag thrown in through the doorway: the whole room is in its danger zone, so it runs out into the
## corridor; after the burst it goes back into the box room and holds there on its order.
##
## Scripted Von (the first option offered; the order level asks nothing). Premises: the thrower is
## an invader puppet that cannot be killed (the scripted world event), armed with one frag the way
## Main arms a spawn; hostility on trespass is off, so the defender does not fight the thrower for
## trespassing, and once it has thrown the thrower walks off out of the defender's line from the box
## room (the reflex and the return are what is watched, not a fight).
