## Issue #51 R12: LOCATE is a walk toward the shots. Shot at from beyond the walkable ground (past
## the outer edge of the ring round the house), the NPC was sent to a point toward the shots that
## the navmesh pulls back to where it already stands: the move ended the tick it began and the
## unchanged situation drew the same order again, every other frame (Invader 8, COMBAT > LOCATE x216
## in a 10v10 match on main). LOCATE is offered only when its walk goes somewhere.
##
## Scripted Von (the loop is in what the snapshot offers, not in Von's pick): COMBAT > LOCATE when
## offered, else what comes first. The bare Terrace house and a lone invader at the west edge of the
## garden ring, facing the house; the shots are `hit` events nobody known fired, from the west,
## landing beside it, one a second so it stays under fire.
