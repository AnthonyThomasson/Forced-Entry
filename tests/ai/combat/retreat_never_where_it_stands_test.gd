## Issue #51 R12: a RETREAT is a walk somewhere. Falling back to an ally it already stands beside,
## the NPC was sent to the ally's own spot: its walk was held short of the body, then ended at the
## free spot beside it, where it already stood, so the move ended the tick it began and the
## unchanged situation drew the same order again, every other frame (Invader 10, COMBAT > RETREAT
## x128 in one 10v10 match). A place to fall back to is open floor a walk away: the spot beside the
## ally, behind it from the threat, and never where the NPC stands nor on a body.
##
## Scripted Von (the loop is in what the snapshot offers, not in Von's pick): COMBAT > RETREAT >
## fall back to the ally. An empty arena (no cover, one room), an invader with an ally 40 px to its
## west and a defender 300 px to its east in plain view.
