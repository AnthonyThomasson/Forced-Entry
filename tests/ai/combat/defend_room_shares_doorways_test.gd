## LD8 / D2 (`docs/leadership.md`): the members ordered to defend a room share out its doorways.
## Each holds a spot back in the room, off its doorway's axis (out of the fatal funnel), with its
## gun on that doorway. Two defenders in the Terrace house's hall are ordered to defend the living
## room, which has two doorways (to the kitchen in its east wall, to the hall in its south wall):
## one takes each, each stands inside the room clear of its doorway's width and back from its wall,
## and each faces its own doorway.
##
## Scripted Von (the first option offered; the order level asks nothing). The doorways are the
## test's own copy of the map's.
