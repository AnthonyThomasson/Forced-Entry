## E9 / G17, the contrast to `locate_not_into_shots_room` (issue #51, R10): shot at by someone it
## cannot see from the open (the line back from the shot runs into no room), the NPC is still
## offered LOCATE, the walk toward the shots.
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: what the COMBAT level offers). The same lone invader in the back
## garden with a stun; the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired, from the open garden to the
## south, landing beside it: the walk toward the shots runs down the garden (shots from beyond the
## walkable ground would give no LOCATE, issue #51 R12, `locate_never_where_it_stands`).
