## E9 as amended (issue #51, R10) / G17: shot at by someone it cannot see from a room it is outside
## of, the NPC treats the shooter as a barricaded hostile and is not offered LOCATE (a walk toward
## the shots, into that room): its COMBAT level offers GRENADE at the shots' origin (or RETREAT)
## instead. The contrast, shots from the open, still offers LOCATE: `locate_toward_shots_from_open`.
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: what the COMBAT level offers). A lone invader in the back garden,
## armed with a stun the way Main arms a spawn; the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired (as
## tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts gunfire), from a spot inside the kitchen out through the
## middle of the back doorway, landing beside the invader, so the line back from it (`shot_from`)
## runs into the kitchen (`stun_entry_shot_from_room`'s premise; a `require` checks it).
