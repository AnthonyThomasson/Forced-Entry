## Issue #51 R12: a RETREAT takes the NPC out of sight of every threat when it stands in sight of
## one, else farther from them. Already out of sight, it was offered every other spot out of sight
## too, nearer the threat included, and in a fight it walked from one to the next and back every
## half second. Out of sight of where the shots came from, no place nearer them is a retreat.
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: what RETREAT offers). The bare Terrace house, an invader in the
## hall; one `hit` event nobody known fired, from the north-east (from the living room, through the
## hall's north wall), lands beside it. The threat the NPC retreats from is where the shots came
## from, `investigate_distance` (300 px) out along the shot: in the living room, behind the wall
## from the hall.
