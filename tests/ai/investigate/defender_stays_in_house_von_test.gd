## Desired: a house defender does not leave its house to investigate gunfire out in the garden.
## Nothing in the code keeps it in: its goal says to hold its ground inside the house, the snapshot
## says the gunfire is outside the house, and Von, asked whether to investigate, judges. Needs the
## Von decision server.
