## Desired: in a quiet house, with nobody to fight or chase, a defender searching its rooms never
## leaves the house. Defenders are placed as Main places them (a clear spot in a random room) in a
## generated house and left alone for a while; every defender must stay within the house's rooms (a
## doorway's depth of slack). `--seed=N` pins the layout, to sweep houses.
