## Desired: the same as defenders_stay_in_house_quiet, but with the real Von deciding and with
## invaders standing outside the house heading for its front door (as in a match, before the fight
## starts): no defender ever steps outside. Needs the Von decision server. `--seed=N` pins the
## layout, to sweep houses.
