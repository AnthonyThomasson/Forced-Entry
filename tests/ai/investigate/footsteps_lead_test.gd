## H1 (`docs/hearing.md`, issue #51, R5), the scenario: a heard footstep is an INVESTIGATE lead
## ("footsteps heard"), like gunfire. A defender in the Terrace house's living room hears an invader
## walking about the kitchen behind the wall, out of its sight, and goes to see: it takes
## INVESTIGATE on the footsteps lead and heads for the kitchen. Real Von at every level; a `require`
## that it heard the steps (its memory, `debug_memory()["footsteps"]`) comes first, so a deaf
## defender reads as the missing hearing, not a Von choice.
##
## Premise: the invader is a puppet (the thing to be heard) that paces a lane in the kitchen's
## south-west, hidden from the living room by the wall between, about 150 px from the defender;
## unkillable, it never shoots.
