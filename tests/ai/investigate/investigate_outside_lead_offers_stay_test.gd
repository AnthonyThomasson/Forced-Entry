## Desired (the wiring): gunfire heard outside the house reaches Von worded as outside, and the
## INVESTIGATE level offers a way to decline the lead (STAY: hold your ground inside the house) next
## to the lead itself. Nothing removes the lead: Von decides, here scripted to decline, and the NPC
## then stays put. What a real Von picks for a defender is `defender_stays_in_house_von`.
