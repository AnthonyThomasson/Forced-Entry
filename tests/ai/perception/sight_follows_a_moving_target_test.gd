## How closely an NPC's sense of sight follows a hostile: it sees one that steps out from behind a
## tall piece of furniture, and loses one that steps behind it, within a few physics frames; and
## while it keeps one in sight the position it holds is never more than a couple of frames behind.
## Von is down, so the NPC holds its post and watches.
