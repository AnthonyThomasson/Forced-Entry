## An ally's round striking close by is not fire at the NPC (issue #51, found while building R11): a
## teammate's shot that lands within `hit_awareness_radius` of an NPC does not put it under fire, as
## it knows who fired; a round from a hostile, or from a shooter it does not know, landing as close
## does, and so does an ally's round that hits the NPC itself. Four invaders stand well apart, each
## held still (`speed` 0, so the distances hold); one `hit` event lands 80 px from each (on the
## fourth, on it), told apart by its attacker. Read off each NPC's memory
## (`debug_memory()["under_fire"]`). Scripted Von (one mechanism).
