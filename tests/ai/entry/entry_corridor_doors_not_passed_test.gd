## E15: a doorway passed in a corridor is searched or secured before the NPC is abreast of it.
## Gunfire is heard from the far room of the corridor spine; whatever Von sends the invader there
## for, the way runs past the open doors of rooms A and B, and each is entered, or at least covered
## from beside its jamb, before the invader walks past it. Real Von: the invader hears the shots and
## decides for itself.
