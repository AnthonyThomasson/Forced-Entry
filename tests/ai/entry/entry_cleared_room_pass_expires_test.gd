## E18 (issue #51, R3): a cleared room counts as safe to walk past for `entry_pass_clear_time` (60
## s) only. A one-room house with its front door in the south wall; an ally radios the room clear.
## Sent east past the house at once, the invader walks the plain way along the south wall through
## the front door's view, neither going round it nor covering the door. Once the clear is more than
## 60 s old, sent back west past the same door it goes round the house or covers the door from the
## jamb first (E15 / E18). Scripted Von (one mechanism): each walk is an investigation of gunfire
## heard on the far side.
##
## The clear's age is the perception memory's, which counts game time (`GameClock`, frames run while
## unpaused); the test waits (`door_view_probe.wait_wall`, paced to real time) until 61 s have
## passed in sim time, and on the wall clock as well. While it waits the invader is held still
## (`movement.speed` 0) where its first walk ended, so the second walk starts from the far side (a
## held move re-decides only at its commit cap, so the second order is waited for).
