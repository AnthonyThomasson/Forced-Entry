## LD9 / D4, D11 (`docs/leadership.md`): a defender ordered to stack. An ordered stack runs whatever
## `tuning.entry.enabled` says, and its approach is guarded like any walk; but for a defender's
## ordered walk across its own house, a room it has seen empty within
## `tuning.entry_guard.pass_clear_time` (60 s) is clear for passing (no entry at a doorway into it),
## while a room it has not seen still gets one.
##
## A corridor with three rooms off its north side (A, B, C) and a den behind room A. A defender
## starts in the corridor (it stands in it: seen, with nobody in it) and is first ordered to defend
## room C, which it walks into. It is then ordered to stack in room A at the den's doorway, into the
## den. Its way there goes back out into the corridor (seen empty seconds ago: no entry at room C's
## doorway) and then into room A, which it has never stood in (an entry at room A's doorway, before
## it is in its funnel), and it then claims its slot at the den's doorway under the order and goes
## in.
##
## Scripted Von, down: the defender's own decisions hold steady, so what it does is the orders'
## alone. "Seen empty" is read here as the room the NPC stood in with nobody hostile in it (a room
## only glimpsed through its doorway on the way is not seen: the plan's open risk).
