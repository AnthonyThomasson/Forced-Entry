## E9 as amended (issue #51, R10): the under-fire exemption does not cover a walk into the room the
## shots come from. A household shooter fires on the invader from the kitchen through the back door
## while it is ordered to rush it. Shot at from a room it is outside of, the invader does not walk
## straight in under fire: it fights from outside (E14) and goes in, if at all, only by an entry it
## stacked for (`going_in` before it stands in the kitchen). The exemption that stays (shots from
## anywhere else) is `entry_guard_under_fire_exempt`.
##
## Premises: the shooter is a puppet that cannot be killed (so it holds the doorway, in view, the
## whole test); the invader cannot be killed either (it takes every round the shooter fires); Von is
## scripted to the rush (`Entry.guard_rules`), so the order is the one a straight walk in would
## follow.
