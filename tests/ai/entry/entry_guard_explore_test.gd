## Desired (E9): an invader that is sent to a room it has not seen goes through every doorway on the
## way by tactical entry, not only the one a ENTER order would name. Von is only asked to explore,
## from the back garden, and the one room left unseen is the living room: two doors deep (the front
## door into the hall, then the hall's door into the living room). Neither doorway is an ENTER
## option, so a plain walk would cross both with no stack and no pie.
