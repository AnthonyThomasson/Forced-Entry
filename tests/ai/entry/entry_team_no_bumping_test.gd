## Issue #53: a team on a tactical entry walks round its own members. A generated house, and four
## invaders placed and armed the way Main does (a match over the house, `tests/_ai/house_probe.gd`:
## in one group outside, out of the exterior doorways' views, heading for the front entrance, the
## invader loadout with its stun and frag, in their side's squad), decide (real Von, the leader, its
## team following it in) to stack on a doorway and go in. For the whole run (the approach, the
## stack, the bang, the crossing, the corners, the clear, and the walks after it) no invader walks
## into a teammate that stands still: it goes round it, or stops short and waits; and no two
## invaders that are both walking collide: one gives way to the other. "Walks into" is measured by
## `tests/_ai/bump_probe.gd` (steering toward a body it touches); two walkers pressing into each
## other head-on make a bump each way, counted as one collision (`Bump.collisions`).
##
## The premise: the house is empty (no defender), so what is judged is the team's own movement, not
## a firefight; nothing else is changed (no switch, prop or timer).
