extends GameTest
## Desired (E15, the limit): a member heading for a stack that others have claimed goes to its door
## as part of the team. An ally has claimed room C's doorway on the radio, so the invader ordered to
## ENTER there does not leave its approach to secure the doors it passes: the point is not left to
## go in alone. It walks the corridor past rooms A and B and stacks at C's door. Scripted Von:
## SEARCH > ENTER > C's doorway. The ally is a puppet in room B that repeats its claim, as a stacked
## teammate's heartbeat does.
