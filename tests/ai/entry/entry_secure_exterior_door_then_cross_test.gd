## E15 as amended (issue #51, R2): with no way round a doorway's view within 2 x the plain route +
## 300 px, a walk that has to cross it first covers the doorway from beside the jamb, then crosses
## the view in one go without stopping; it never goes in. Now for a walk outside the house past an
## exterior door too. The invader stands in the garden west of the Terrace house's living room and
## gunfire is heard in the garden south-west of the hall; the only short way there runs down the
## west side, across the view out of the front door; round the house's east side is more than twice
## as far, past the cap. Real Von: the invader hears the shots and decides for itself; a `require`
## that it went to the gunfire without going in comes first.
##
## Premise: the gunfire is one shot heard in the south-west garden (a `hit` event nobody known
## fired, as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`, the frame the invader
## spawns in, so it is in its first decision.
