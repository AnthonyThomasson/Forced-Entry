## Desired (E1 to E5): an invader entering a room never runs, from the moment it heads for the door
## until it is in its corner. A running character cannot shoot (`Character.weapon.shoot()` is
## ignored while running), so a sprint to the stack or through the doorway is a lowered gun at the
## worst moment. It starts far from the kitchen's back door, well past the distance from which a run
## would start.
