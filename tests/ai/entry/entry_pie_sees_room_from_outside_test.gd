## Desired (E3): before it crosses, an invader slices the pie: it looks across the kitchen's back
## door in angle steps from outside and so sees at least half of the room (and both of its far
## corners) without setting foot inside. The corners it notes as still hidden are only ever on the
## door's own wall (a far corner is always in view of the pie).
