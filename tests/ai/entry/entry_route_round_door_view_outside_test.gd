## E18 (issue #51, R1): a walk outside the house keeps out of the view of an open doorway into a
## room that is not clear for passing, when a way round is no longer than 2 x the plain route + 300
## px. A one-room house with its front door in the south wall; the invader stands west of it and
## gunfire is heard east of it, outside. The plain way there runs along the south wall, through the
## view out of the front door (every point of the outdoor strip south of the house is in it); the
## way round the north side is about 1.2 x as long, so it is the one walked. Real Von: the invader
## hears the shots and decides for itself; a `require` that it went to the far side without going
## into the house comes first, so a different Von choice reads as a set-up finding.
##
## Premise: the gunfire is one shot heard east of the house (a `hit` event nobody known fired, as
## tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`, the frame the invader spawns in,
## so it is in its first decision.
