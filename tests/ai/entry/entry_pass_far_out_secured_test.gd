## E15 as amended (issue #51, R2): a doorway's view is secured however far out from its wall the
## walk crosses it, not only within 150 px. A big hall with a long, narrow store room off its north
## wall: the view out of the store room's doorway is a band down the hall, reaching to within a
## body's width of the south wall, so there is no way round it. Gunfire is heard at the hall's east
## end; the invader at its west end walks there across the band 300 px out from the doorway: it
## first covers the doorway from beside the jamb, then crosses the band in one go, and never goes
## in. Real Von: the invader hears the shots and decides for itself; a `require` that it went to the
## gunfire without going into the store room comes first.
##
## Premise: the gunfire is one shot heard at the hall's east end (a `hit` event nobody known fired,
## as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`, the frame the invader spawns
## in, so it is in its first decision.
