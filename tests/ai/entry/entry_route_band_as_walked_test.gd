## E18 (issue #51, R9): the route bands Von reads ("short / medium / long route") measure the route
## the NPC will walk: the door-avoiding one when it would take it, else the plain one. A small
## one-room house with its front door in the south wall; the invader stands west of it and gunfire
## is heard east of it. The plain way there, along the south wall through the front door's view, is
## a short route (under 400 px); the way the invader walks, round the house's north side out of the
## view (within the cap), is a medium one. The gunfire lead's option says "medium route". Scripted
## Von (one mechanism: the wording), the invader held still (`movement:speed` 0) so the snapshot is
## the one taken from where it stands.
