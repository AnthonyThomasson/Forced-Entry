## Desired (E8): once a pair has cleared the kitchen (in by the back door), each of them covers a
## different one of the kitchen's doorways on into rooms nobody has cleared, the living room's and
## the hall's: it stands in the kitchen with its gun through that doorway. Neither is left watching
## the garden they came from while a doorway on is unwatched.
