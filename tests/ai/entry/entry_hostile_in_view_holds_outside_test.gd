## E14: a hostile seen through the door is fought from outside, and nobody crosses while it stands
## in view. A defender in the kitchen, out of sight of the stack but in view of the pie, is seen and
## shot at from outside; it cannot be killed and does not move, so the invader must never go in: not
## by the entry, and not by whatever fight Von chooses once it has engaged. Real Von: the invader
## stands in the back garden and decides for itself.
