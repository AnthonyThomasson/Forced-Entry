## Desired (E9): closing in on a hostile in the next room is no excuse to skip the entry. The
## invader sees a household target through the kitchen's back door and is ordered to rush it; the
## straight route is through that doorway, so it stacks beside it and slices the pie first, and it
## does not run from the moment it turns to the door. The target can be killed (E14: nobody crosses
## while a hostile stands in view with a line of fire, so the invader shoots it from outside first
## and goes in once it is down).
