## Desired (E3 "what it sees from outside it engages from outside", docs/gaze-and-fire.md W2): an
## invader stacking at a doorway with a hostile in plain view through it shoots, whatever the phase.
## Rushing a target seen through the back door puts the invader into an entry detour (approach,
## stack, pie) with the order to fight stashed behind the stack; from the first claim on the radio
## until it goes in, it must fire from outside the doorway all the same. The target can be killed
## (E14: nobody crosses while a hostile stands in view with a line of fire, so the invader fires
## from outside until it is down and goes in after).
