## E17 / E9 (issue #51, R10): a suspect room means a bang for every entry, not only SEARCH's. An
## invader with a stun is sent to search the living room, two doors deep through the kitchen (a
## plain search order, so the entry guard turns its walk through the back door into an entry, E9);
## gunfire heard in the kitchen before it sets off makes the kitchen suspect (G18). The detour's
## entry into the kitchen goes in with a bang: its claim says bang, it radios `bang` and a stun goes
## off in the kitchen before it goes in. The contrast, the same walk into an unsuspected kitchen, is
## `entry_guard_quiet_unsuspected_room`.
##
## Scripted Von (SEARCH > the living room: one mechanism, the guard's entry). The invader knows the
## house (`familiar_with_house`, as `entry_guard_search_room`) and carries a stun, armed the way
## Main arms a spawn. The gunfire is a `hit` event nobody known fired, in the kitchen (as
## tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`.
