## E19 (issue #51, R4): a split stack and the criss-cross. Two invaders come at the Terrace house's
## back door from opposite sides of the garden, one north of it and one south. A member that would
## have to cross the door's view to reach the stack side stacks on its own side instead (the claim
## carries the side), so each stands on its own side of the door and neither walks through its view
## before the entry. Each side's front man slices its own half of the pie; the point (the first
## claimer) crosses to the corner on the far side, and the other side's front man, after the point's
## `in`, to the opposite corner. Real Von: both invaders decide for themselves; a `require` that
## both claimed the back door comes first, so a different Von choice reads as a set-up finding.
