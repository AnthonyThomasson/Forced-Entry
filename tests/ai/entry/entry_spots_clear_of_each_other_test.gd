## Issue #53 (E2, E8): the spots an entry hands its members do not overlap. A stack of four lines up
## in the garden at the back door: each member's slot lies clear of its neighbours' footprints,
## outside the hole a body standing on the neighbouring slot cuts in the map the NPCs walk round
## bodies by (a body's radius, `NavBuilder.OBSTACLE_MARGIN` and the walker's own radius). After the
## clear, the kitchen has two doorways on (the living room's and the hall's): two members cover them
## and the spare two hold the rear, each at a spot of its own, clear of the other the same way.
##
## Read through the brain's published entry view (`debug_entry_view`: `my_slot`, `rear_spot`,
## `phase`). Scripted Von (`Entry.rules`: SEARCH > ENTER > that doorway), bare rooms, invaders that
## cannot die (`Entry.npc`).
