## Desired (E15): the walk to a doorway's own stack passes other doors too. Ordered to ENTER room C
## from the corridor's west end, the invader goes past the open doors of rooms A and B on the way:
## it secures each once (a pass-by entry: stack beside the jamb, one side of the pie, nothing
## radioed), takes up its ENTER order again from the start, and stacks at C's door and goes in. A
## doorway it has secured is left alone while the order carries on, so each is secured exactly once.
## Scripted Von: SEARCH > ENTER > C's doorway.
