## LD9 / D3 (`docs/leadership.md`): what the leader's click on a doorway decides. The side of the
## wall plane clicked is the side the stack forms on, so the room it goes into is the other one;
## left or right of the opening along the wall picks the stack's side of the door; a click on the
## opening (within its half-width along the wall) is a split stack; an exterior door always goes
## into the house's room, whichever side is clicked.
##
## A lone invader in the Terrace house's back garden, straight out from the back door (on its axis:
## neither side is nearer), is ordered to stack with a click south of the opening, then north of it:
## its stack slot is south of the door, then north. The squad's resolution of four more clicks is
## read off the orders it posts: inside the kitchen at the back door (still into the kitchen), on
## either side of the kitchen–living doorway (into the room on the far side), and on the back door's
## opening (a split stack).
##
## Scripted Von, down: the member's own decisions hold steady, so what it does is the order's alone.
