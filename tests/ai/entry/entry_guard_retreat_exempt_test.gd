## Desired (E9, the exemption): a retreat does not stop to stack. The invader, in the hall, sees a
## defender in the living room through its door and falls back to the kitchen, by whichever way is
## shorter (through the hall's door or through the living room). None of those rooms is cleared, but
## a retreating NPC has no time to stack, so it crosses with no entry.
