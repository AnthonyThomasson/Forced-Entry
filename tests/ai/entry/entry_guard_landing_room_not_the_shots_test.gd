## E9 (`docs/tactical-entry.md`): under fire, a walk goes through a doorway without an entry unless
## it leads into the room the shots came from, and that room is the one behind the doorway the shots
## came through, not the room they landed in. An invader in the Terrace house's kitchen is shot at
## from the living room, through the doorway between them, and steps out into the hall; still under
## fire, it is ordered to rush a householder in the kitchen. The kitchen is only where it stood when
## the shot landed: it walks straight back in through the hall's doorway, without stacking for it.
## (Into the room the shots came from it goes only by entry: `entry_guard_shot_from_room_ahead`.)
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: the guard's exemption), the rush as in
## `entry_guard_under_fire_exempt` (`Entry.guard_rules`). Premises: the householder is a puppet that
## never shoots and cannot be killed, and the invader cannot be killed; the shot is one `hit` event
## nobody known fired (as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts gunfire), landing beside the invader;
## once it has been taken in, the invader is moved into the hall (it "steps" there), facing the
## householder through the doorway.
