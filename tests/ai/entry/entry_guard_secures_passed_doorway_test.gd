## Desired (E15): a plain walk down a corridor goes past the open doors of rooms A and B. The guard
## secures each one before the invader is abreast of it, without entering: it stacks beside the jamb
## on the side it comes from, slices one side of the pie with its gun on the doorway, and walks on.
## Nothing is radioed for it (no claim, no going in). Scripted Von: an investigation of gunfire in
## the far room, heard before the invader's first decision, so the order is not an ENTER.
