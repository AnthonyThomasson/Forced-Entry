## Issue #53, one mechanism: an entry's walk that a teammate's body seals re-plans; it is never held
## for ever. A row of counters splits the room the invader starts in, with one gap a body wide by
## the south wall, and a teammate stands still in the gap. The invader is ordered to ENTER the
## doorway on the far side of the row (scripted Von): its walk to its stack slot has no way but the
## gap. It stops short of the teammate, waits a moment, and re-plans within `REPLAN_S` s of
## stopping: the entry is given up (`abort` on the radio) and the NPC re-decides BECAUSE the way is
## blocked (`debug_state()`: `decisions` grows with `decision_reason` "way blocked"). It never walks
## into the teammate or moves it, and it is never held (`loco.way` "held") for `REPLAN_S` s without
## such a re-plan. The test requires that the steering map really had the gap sealed when the walker
## came near, before it judges.
##
## Switches and props: the teammate is an invader puppet that stands still and cannot die (the body
## at rest the scenario is about); scripted Von and the shared entry switches; nothing else changed.
