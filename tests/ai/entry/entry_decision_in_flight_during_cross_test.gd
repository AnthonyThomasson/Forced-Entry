## Desired (E4): nothing stops an entrant in the threshold, not even a decision the planner had
## already started walking before the crossing began. Such a decision arrives while the invader is
## crossing; it waits (the entry ends in a re-decision of its own) instead of replacing the entry,
## so the invader is not left standing in the doorway.
