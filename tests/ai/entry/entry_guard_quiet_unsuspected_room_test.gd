## E17 / E9 (issue #51, R10), the contrast to `entry_guard_bang_suspect_room`: the same walk with
## nothing to suspect the kitchen of. An invader with a stun is sent to search the living room, two
## doors deep through the kitchen; the entry guard turns its walk through the back door into an
## entry (E9), and with no reason to think a hostile is in the kitchen it goes in quietly: its calls
## say quiet, no bang is radioed and no stun is thrown.
##
## Scripted Von (SEARCH > the living room: one mechanism, the guard's entry). The invader knows the
## house (`familiar_with_house`, as `entry_guard_search_room`) and carries a stun, armed the way
## Main arms a spawn.
