## Desired (E8): a doorway on into a room nobody has cleared comes first, and a member left over
## holds the rear. A pair clears the living room, in from the hall: its one doorway on is the
## kitchen's, so one of them covers it, gun through it from inside the living room, and the other
## stays on the hall door as rear security, just inside it and facing back out the way they came.
