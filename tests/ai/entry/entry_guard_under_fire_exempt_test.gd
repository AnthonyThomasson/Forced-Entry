## Desired (E9, the exemption as amended by issue #51 R10): an NPC that is being shot at from
## anywhere but the room ahead does not stop to stack. The invader is ordered to rush a householder
## in the kitchen; a household shooter behind it in the back garden, out of its sight, fires on it.
## It may start to stack before the first round lands, but once it is hit it gives the entry up
## (radios abort) and goes straight through, never crossing as an entry. (Shot at from the kitchen
## itself, it goes in only by entry: `entry_guard_shot_from_room_ahead`.)
##
## Premises: both householders are puppets that cannot be killed, the one in the kitchen never
## shoots; the invader cannot be killed either; Von is scripted to the rush (`Entry.guard_rules`).
## The shooter stands behind the invader, farther than its awareness and outside its view cone, so
## the round comes from a stranger in the garden, not from the room it is ordered into.
