## E18 (issue #51, R1): inside the house, a walk keeps out of the view of an open doorway into a
## room that is not clear for passing, when a way round is no longer than 2 x the plain route + 300
## px. A big hall with a long, narrow store room off its north wall, whose doorway's view is a band
## down the hall that ends 165 px short of the south wall: the hall's east end is reachable two ways
## from its west end, straight through the band or round its far end, about 1.3 x as long. Gunfire
## is heard at the east end; the invader gets there the way round, never through the store room's
## view. (`entry_pass_far_out_secured` is the same hall with the band reaching the south wall: no
## way round, so the doorway is secured and the band crossed.) Real Von: the invader hears the shots
## and decides for itself; a `require` that it got to the east end without going into the store room
## comes first.
##
## Premise: the gunfire is one shot heard at the hall's east end (a `hit` event nobody known fired,
## as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`, the frame the invader spawns
## in, so it is in its first decision.
