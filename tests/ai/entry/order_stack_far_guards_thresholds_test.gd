## LD9 / D4 (`docs/leadership.md`): a stack ordered from across the house guards each threshold it
## passes. An unordered entry's approach meets the guard only for doorway views
## (`entries._guard_approach`), not for thresholds. An invader standing in the Terrace house's
## living room is ordered to stack in the hall at the kitchen–hall doorway, into the kitchen; its
## way there goes through the hall–living doorway into the hall, a room nobody has cleared. It goes
## into the hall by tactical entry first (a detour: `going_in` for that doorway before it is ever in
## its funnel, no pause in it), then the ordered entry restarts afresh and it claims its slot at the
## kitchen doorway under the order and goes in.
##
## Scripted Von, down: the member's own decisions hold steady, so what it does is the order's alone
## (the guard's detour asks Von nothing). The squad is built and bound as a match's (`s.squads`, a
## puppet standing in for the human leader, in the garden across the house), and the order comes
## from it, as the leader's menu sends it, on the first frame: before the invader has set off to
## follow its leader.
