## Desired (E6, E9): when Von cannot be reached the NPC takes its steady stance, and a tactical
## entry it was stacked for is given up with it: the stack is told over the radio (`abort`), so the
## rest of the team stops counting on it. The server goes down while the invader is stacked at the
## back door; a defender it then sees through the door during the pie forces a decision, which
## fails.
