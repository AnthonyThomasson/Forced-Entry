## Desired (B2): never walk a flank route past the target itself. A target holds the living room
## facing the hall door where the NPC watches it: its right (west) side and its rear are only
## reachable by walking across its field of view and right past it, so both are dropped as
## `crosses`; the open east side is the one flank left.
