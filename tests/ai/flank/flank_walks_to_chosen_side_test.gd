## Desired (B9): once a side is chosen the NPC commits. The NPC watches the target in the living
## room from the hall, scripted to flank left: it goes in through the hall door, walks round the
## room to the target's left in the target's own frame, and fires at it from there, without stalling
## on the way. A low coffee table just inside the door blocks every line of fire from the hall (E14:
## nobody crosses while a hostile stands in view with a line of fire, so with a clear shot from
## outside the NPC would stay there and shoot) but not sight, which looks over it: the flank is the
## only way to a shot.
