## Desired (B8): a territorial defender does not leave its house to flank. An intruder stands by the
## kitchen's back door, facing into the house, so its rear is the garden beyond the open door, with
## a clear shot through it. The defender weighs that side, the description says outside the house,
## and it is not offered; the sides inside the kitchen are.
