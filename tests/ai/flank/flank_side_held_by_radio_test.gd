## Desired (B4): a side an ally has radioed is its own. An ally in the kitchen, out of the NPC's
## sight, radios that it is going to the target's left; the NPC in the living room is told the side
## is 'taken by … (radio)' and is not offered it, while the right side is. (The call's lapse after
## `callout_ttl` is not tested: memory ages in wall-clock ms, which a headless fixed-fps run
## outruns.)
