## Desired (B3): never flank across a friend's line of fire. An ally holds the east end of a
## warehouse and shoots west at the target; the NPC comes up from the south-east. Walking round to
## the target's north side would cut across the ally's line of fire, so that side is not offered;
## the south and west sides, whose routes stay clear of the line, are. The NPC stands where the ally
## is inside its view cone (110°, so the ally must bear within 55° of its line to the target): it
## only weighs allies it can see.
