## Desired (B6): a spot with no shot is not a flank. A row of shelving stands between the target and
## the whole south side, so every point there has the line blocked and cover (the shelves) in the
## way: the NPC is told 'line blocked from there' with that cover, and the side is not offered; the
## open sides are.
