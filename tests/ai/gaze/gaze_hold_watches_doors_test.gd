## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W4): an NPC standing with no threat known watches the doors of its
## room, rotating among them, instead of keeping whatever way it last happened to face (a wall, or
## the world origin on a fresh NPC). With every decision failing (server down) the defender sits in
## the steady hold; spawned looking at the kitchen's north wall it must come round to the kitchen's
## doorways and keep to them.

## The kitchen's three doorways (back garden, hall, living room), on the wall centrelines.
