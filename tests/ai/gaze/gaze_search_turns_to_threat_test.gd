## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W1, W2): a known hostile in view takes the NPC's eyes and gun
## whatever it is doing. An invader sent to search the living room covers it by sight once it
## arrives, turning its gaze to the nearest corner it has not seen and ignoring everything else for
## up to 8 s; a Von that answers slowly (each answer held back 1.5 s) leaves it in that coverage a
## good while after the defender in the corner came into view. It must keep its eyes on the defender
## and shoot it, not look away at the empty floor.
