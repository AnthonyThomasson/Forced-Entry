## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W4): a walking NPC with nothing to fear looks where it is going,
## along its path, not at the wall the next navmesh waypoint happens to line up with. Steering at
## the immediate waypoint points the gaze at the door jamb and the wall beside a doorway as it turns
## the corner; it should look a few paces down the path instead, through the door. Walking from the
## hall's middle into the living room through its door, the invader must never have a wall at arm's
## length dead ahead and must keep where it is going inside its own view cone (55 deg either side of
## its facing, the vision default): the spot it will reach 0.7 s later.
