## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W5): a walk that has arrived stops, even with the next decision
## still in flight (a slow Von): it neither keeps walking on into the wall ahead nor stares along
## its travel vector. Sent to the hall from the kitchen with every answer held back 1 s, the
## defender must stand still once it is in the hall and not face a wall.
