## Desired (docs/gaze-and-fire.md W4): an NPC that was never given an aim looks where its body
## points, not at the world's origin. Outside the house there is no room and so no doorway to watch,
## which leaves a resting NPC's gaze as it is: an invader standing in the garden with every decision
## failing (server down), facing south, must still face south a second later, and not have swung
## round to the world's origin.
