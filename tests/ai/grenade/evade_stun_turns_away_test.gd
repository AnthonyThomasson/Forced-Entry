## G16, the last resort: an NPC that cannot get clear of a stun in the fuse it has left turns its
## back to it. A defender stands in the north-east corner of a room; a hostile invader throws a stun
## that lands beside it. The corner leaves no way out of the flash radius (400 px) in 1.5 s, so the
## defender faces away from the burst and is blinded for only the back-turned share (x0.25) of the
## time.
##
## Premise: the thrower is an invader *puppet* that cannot be killed (the scripted world event),
## armed here as Main arms a spawn. A premise check reads that the defender was still inside the
## flash radius when it went off.
