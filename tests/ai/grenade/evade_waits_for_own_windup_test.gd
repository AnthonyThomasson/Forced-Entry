## G16 with G17: the evade reflex takes priority over every primitive but one moment, the NPC's own
## grenade in the wind-up. That grenade cannot be called back and leaves the hand at most a wind-up
## (0.3 s) later toward where it is aimed; turning away to run meanwhile would throw it the wrong
## way. So a thrower in its wind-up when a grenade lands beside it throws first, onto its spot, and
## runs the moment it has let go. One mechanism, scripted Von (COMBAT > GRENADE): an invader with a
## stun winds up a throw at a household puppet hidden behind a desk; as the wind-up begins, a
## teammate's stun comes down beside it, in its view from the moment it is let go (a premise: let go
## by the teammate, a puppet off to the side). The invader's stun bursts on the puppet, and the
## invader then runs from the teammate's stun.
##
## Premises: the puppets cannot be killed and never shoot; the teammate's stun is let go by the
## item's own release (`ThrownGrenade.spawn`) at the start of the invader's wind-up; the invader is
## armed at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
