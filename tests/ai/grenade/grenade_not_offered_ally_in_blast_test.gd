## G17, the dropping rule for an ally: GRENADE is never offered when a known ally would be inside
## that grenade's danger zone at the landing spot (the option's `ally_in_blast` tag is in the
## tactic's `drop_tags`). One mechanism: an invader with a frag, a hostile behind a desk 420 px off
## (outside the invader's own zone, so only the ally matters; the thrower's own zone is
## `grenade_not_offered_no_safe_spot`). Scripted Von; the same scene is read twice: nobody in the
## way (GRENADE is offered), then an ally beside the hostile (dropped).
