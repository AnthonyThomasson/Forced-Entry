## G18 as amended (issue #51, R6) and E9 as amended (R10): a room the NPC was shot at from is
## suspect, and the NPC does not walk into the shooter. A shot from inside the kitchen, out through
## its back door, lands beside the stack of two invaders (both carrying a stun) in the back garden;
## nobody is seen. Shot at from a room they are outside of, they treat it as a barricaded hostile:
## neither walks in through that doorway unguarded (no LOCATE straight in under fire, the E9
## exemption does not cover a walk into the room the shots came from), and before anyone goes in the
## stack takes STUN ENTRY or throws a grenade into the kitchen. Fully natural: real Von at every
## level, whatever it makes of the shot; a `require` that the shot registered (the stack was under
## fire, or remembers where it was shot at from) comes first.
##
## Premise: the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired (as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts
## gunfire), landing within the stack's awareness, its direction the line from a spot inside the
## kitchen out through the middle of the doorway (clear of both jambs, so a bullet could have come
## that way); posted first thing in `run`, so it is in the stack's first decision. A `require`
## checks that each invader's line back from the shot (`debug_memory()["shot_from"]`) runs into the
## kitchen. The invaders start in the garden north-east of the house, about 340 px from the doorway
## along that line. Both are armed with a stun at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
