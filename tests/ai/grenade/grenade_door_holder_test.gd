## G17 as amended (issue #51, R7): GRENADE is offered against a hostile whose last-known spot is in
## a room the NPC is outside of, even with a line of fire: a defender barricaded in a room is
## grenaded, not only shot at. A householder holds the kitchen's back doorway from just inside it,
## facing out; an invader in the garden with a frag sees it through the doorway with a clear shot.
## It throws the frag into the kitchen onto it (the lob, ally and self-safety rules unchanged: it
## can step behind the wall out of the blast). The whole pipeline runs with real Von; a `require`
## that the invader is fighting the householder from outside the kitchen comes first.
## (`grenade_not_offered_clear_shot` stays as it is: a hostile in the open in the NPC's own room, in
## its line of fire, is shot.)
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet that cannot be killed and never shoots (a defender that
## stands its ground in the doorway whatever is fired at it); the invader is armed with one frag at
## the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
