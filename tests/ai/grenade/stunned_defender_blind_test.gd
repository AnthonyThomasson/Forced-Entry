## G15, blind: a flash-blinded NPC sees nothing new and starts no new decision. It does not spot an
## invader that walks in front of it, so what it knows of it stays where it was last seen; it may
## fire blindly at that last-known spot (with the stun's sway, at most 25 degrees off); and when the
## blindness lifts it re-decides from what it sees. A defender is fighting a hostile it can see; the
## flash hits it; the hostile then walks across its front. S6 (ticket #56): whether it fires blind
## is one roll against its `blind_fire_chance` as it goes blind; this defender's is 1, so it does,
## and one-handed (S4: its other hand over its eyes, `Character.one_handed()`). The 0 case is
## `stunned_defender_holds_fire`.
##
## Premises: the flash is `take_stun(6, 6)` called on the defender, as a grenade's flash would (the
## grenade's own throw is tested elsewhere); the hostile is an invader *puppet* that cannot be
## killed and never shoots. Real Von; everything else is on.
