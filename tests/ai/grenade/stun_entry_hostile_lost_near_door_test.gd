## G18 as amended (issue #51, R6): a room is suspect when a hostile was lost near its doorway or
## heading in, not only when it was seen going in. An invader carrying a stun, in the back garden
## south-east of the kitchen, sees a householder in the garden walking toward the back door; it
## passes behind a tall wardrobe standing out in the garden and is lost there, outside the room,
## near the doorway and heading for it (it then goes in and hides in the kitchen's south-east
## corner, out of sight of the garden). The invader's first decision made with it lost is STUN ENTRY
## into the kitchen (alone, it is its own thrower), not an investigation of where it was last seen
## or heading, nor the quiet ENTER. Real Von (whatever it does about the householder while it sees
## it); a `require` that the householder was last seen outside the kitchen, near its doorway (so
## this is not the "seen going in" case already built), and that the invader went for the kitchen by
## its back door, comes before the check. A lone invader, so no teammate's radio of the same fight
## is a lead of its own to weigh.
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet (unkillable, it never shoots) on a set walk; the wardrobe
## is the prop that loses it: it blocks the sight lines from the invader's corner of the garden to
## the last stretch before the door, and stands clear of the slots south of the door, the pie and
## the lob through the doorway. The invader is armed with a stun at the start of `run`.
