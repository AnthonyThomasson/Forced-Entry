## G18, the bang entry: a stack of two invaders, both carrying a stun, at the back door of a kitchen
## where gunfire was heard (and where a defender is) takes STUN ENTRY instead of the quiet ENTER.
## Once the stack is ready the thrower (the slot-2 member when it carries a stun) radios `bang` and
## throws the stun to the room's far side through the doorway; every member holds its slot turned
## away from the door; on the detonation the point skips the pie and crosses at once. The defender
## inside is blinded. The whole pipeline runs: the heard gunfire, the snapshot's entries, real Von
## choosing STUN ENTRY over ENTER, the stack on the radio, the bang. A `require` that the AI took
## STUN ENTRY comes first, so a different Von choice reads as a set-up finding.
##
## Premises: the gunfire is one shot heard from the kitchen (`hit` event with nobody known behind
## it, as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), at the start so it is in the first decision;
## both invaders are armed with a stun here because the test world keeps the default inventory, the
## way Main arms a spawn; and the defender is waiting in the room (seated on a kitchen chair facing
## into it, started through `interact_with` at the start of `run`, as in `evade_frag_ally_warned`):
## left to itself it walks out of the kitchen to search the living room within the 4 s the stack
## takes to get its stun off, and the check is about someone in the room.
