extends GameTest
## E17 extended (issue #51, R8): once its own or a teammate's stun or frag bursts in a room, the
## entry into it skips the pie and crosses at once (and E14's hold is lifted for `BANG_WINDOW`, 3
## s). A householder holds the kitchen's back doorway from 110 px inside it, facing out, in the line
## of fire of an invader in the garden (the scene of `grenade_door_holder`, where Von takes GRENADE
## against a defender barricaded in a room, G17 / R7); the invader carries a stun, takes GRENADE and
## stuns it, then goes in after it (G17: a blinded hostile is the moment to close in). The entry it
## goes in by never slices the pie: from its slot it crosses at once. The whole pipeline runs with
## real Von; `require`s that the invader took GRENADE, that its own stun went off in the kitchen and
## that it then went in by the back door come first, so a fight kept up from outside reads as a
## set-up finding.
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet that cannot be killed and never shoots (a defender that
## stands its ground in the doorway whatever is fired at it); the invader is armed with one stun at
## the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
