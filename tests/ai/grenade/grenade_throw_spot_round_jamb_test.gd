## G17, the lob judged as the grenade flies: a lob that clears the jamb by a ray from the thrower's
## centre but not from its throwing hand is not a clear lob, so GRENADE is offered through a throw
## spot, not in place, and the grenade really goes in. The Terrace house, bare; an invader with a
## stun outside the back door, off its axis to the north-east, sees a household puppet in the
## kitchen through it. From where it stands the line from its centre to the puppet clears the north
## jamb, the lob from its hand (where the Character says a grenade leaves it,
## `throw_release_offset`: 6 px behind it, 15 px to its right; 8 px either side) does not; thrown
## from there, a stun strikes the jamb more often than not. Scripted Von (COMBAT > GRENADE > stun
## when offered): its first COMBAT decision, made where it stands, offers GRENADE through a throw
## spot a short walk away with a clear lob from the hand; the throw leaves from that spot and the
## stun bursts in the kitchen on the puppet.
##
## Premises: the puppet cannot be killed and never shoots; the invader is armed at the start of
## `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
