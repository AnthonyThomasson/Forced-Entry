## G17 as amended by issue #51 R13, the mechanism for an NPC outside a wall: with no clear lob from
## where it stands (the house wall is in the way) and a doorway a short walk away, GRENADE is
## offered through a throw spot at the doorway, not in place, and the throw leaves from there,
## within range. The Terrace house, bare; an invader with a stun outside the back door sees a
## household puppet in the kitchen through it.
##
## Premise (it stands for a peek-and-cover duck, or a retreat, after the sighting, before a decision
## lands: the way the case arises in matches): scripted Von answers slowly (30 physics frames a
## level); the invader's first question is asked in sight, and while it is in flight the invader is
## moved 140 px north, behind the kitchen's east wall, where the wall stops a lob to the puppet's
## spot (still in throw range), and Von is down for that question (`DecisionStub.fail`, set only
## until it has failed), so no order made in sight is carried out. The first decision the invader
## acts on is made behind the wall, with the contact still fresh: it must offer GRENADE through a
## throw spot at the back doorway, and the throw must leave from that spot, within range, and burst
## in the kitchen on the puppet. Case (b) of R13 has no real-Von scenario: a hostile the NPC knows
## of is one it saw a moment ago, and the lob to where it saw it is the clear sight line it saw it
## along, so the case needs the NPC to have moved since, which a real-Von test cannot steer.
##
## Other premises: the puppet cannot be killed and never shoots; the invader is armed at the start
## of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
