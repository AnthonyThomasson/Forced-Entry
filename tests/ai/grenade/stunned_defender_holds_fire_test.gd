## S6 (ticket #56) with G15: an NPC that goes blind rolls once against its `blind_fire_chance`; on a
## miss it holds its fire until it can see. This defender's chance is 0. It is fighting a hostile it
## can see when the flash hits it; the hostile then walks across its front. While blind it fires no
## round, it does not spot the hostile, and what it knows of it stays where it was last seen; when
## the blindness lifts it re-reads the hostile where it stands. (The chance 1 case, blind fire
## one-handed, is `stunned_defender_blind`.)
##
## Premises as `stunned_defender_blind`: the flash is `take_stun(6, 6)` called on the defender, as a
## grenade's flash would; the hostile is an invader *puppet* that cannot be killed and never shoots.
## Real Von; everything else is on.
