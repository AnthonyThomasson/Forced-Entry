## G16: the speed an NPC counts on to reach a safe spot before the fuse runs out
## (`AgentThrow.run_speed`) is, once its stamina is low, its walk as the body is now
## (`CharacterMovement.walk_speed()`), not its tuned `movement.speed`: a stunned body walks at
## `CharacterStunConfig.speed` of it and a full plated kit about 8% slower, so both count on less.
## Three bodies with the same `movement.speed` and an empty stamina bar: one bare, one stunned, one
## in the plated kit.
