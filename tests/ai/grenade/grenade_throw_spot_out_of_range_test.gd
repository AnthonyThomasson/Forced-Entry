## G17's throw spots, the mechanism: GRENADE is also offered against a hostile out of throw range
## from where the NPC stands, if a reachable throw spot exists (a point on the navmesh within the
## grenade's range of the hostile's spot, with a clear lob, a short walk away); the `throw`
## primitive walks there and throws from it, and the self-safety tag (`no_safe_spot`) is judged with
## the thrower at the throw spot. Scripted Von (COMBAT > GRENADE when offered, else ENGAGE ...), two
## closed rooms with a wall between, the same scene in each: an invader 640 px from a household
## puppet hidden from its line of fire by a coffee table (which a lob clears), in neither room in
## range from where it stands (550 px, the throw range).
##
## North: the invader carries a stun. GRENADE is offered through a throw spot (the controller's
## `debug_zones()`, category `grenade`, `from`) within range of the hostile's spot, with a clear
## lob, reached by a short walk; the invader walks there and throws from it, and the stun goes off
## on the hostile. South: the invader carries a frag whose row is retuned (a premise: blast radius
## 480 px, so its danger zone, 600 px, reaches past the throw range, and a 0.5 s fuse) so that every
## spot within throw range of the hostile is inside the zone with nowhere to get clear in time,
## while where the invader stands (640 px) is outside it. Judged from the throw spot the option is
## tagged `no_safe_spot` and GRENADE is not offered; judged from where it stands it would be
## offered.
##
## Premises: the hostiles are household puppets that cannot be killed and never shoot; each invader
## is armed at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn; the frag row is retuned (above).
