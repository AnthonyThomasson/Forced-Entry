## G18 / E17: the stun goes into the room as far as it reaches, not only to its far side. The
## Terrace house's front door is at the west end of the hall, 840 px long: its far side is beyond a
## stun's reach (550 px) from beside the door. An invader with a stun takes STUN ENTRY at the front
## door; it plans the throw onto the farthest point along the hall it reaches with a clear lob,
## radios `bang`, and the stun goes off in the hall, well inside it (at least `BANG_MIN_DEPTH`, 120
## px, from the doorway), before it goes in; the invader, beside the wall outside, is not flashed.
##
## Scripted Von (SEARCH > STUN ENTRY > the front door: one mechanism, the throw's aim). The invader
## carries a stun, armed the way Main arms a spawn (a test world keeps the default inventory).
