## G18 as amended (issue #51, R6): footsteps heard in a room make it suspect, as gunfire heard there
## does. The stack of two invaders, both carrying a stun, in the back garden by the kitchen's back
## door hears someone walking about the kitchen's north-east corner, behind the wall and out of
## their sight: it goes in by STUN ENTRY, not the quiet ENTER. The whole pipeline runs with real
## Von; a `require` that the stack went for the kitchen by its back door comes first.
## (`quiet_entry_unsuspected_room` is the control: nothing heard, ENTER.)
##
## It judges the entry the stack WENT IN WITH, not its first decision
## (`Suspect.check_stun_entry_gone_in`, issue #51 R11): the invaders decide on their first frames,
## and the first of them can decide before the walker's first step reaches it, so it may take the
## quiet ENTER and hear the steps while it lines up. A late reason turns a quiet entry into a bang
## before anyone crosses (`docs/tactical-entry.md` E17), so the check is that each member heard the
## steps before it took STUN ENTRY, that every member went in under STUN ENTRY, and that a bang was
## radioed and a stun went off in the kitchen before anyone went in or stood in it.
##
## Premise: the walker is a household puppet (the thing to be heard) pacing a short lane in the
## corner, 150 to 240 px from the stack through the wall and hidden from every spot outside the back
## door; unkillable, it never shoots. Both invaders are armed with a stun at the start of `run`, the
## way Main arms a spawn.
