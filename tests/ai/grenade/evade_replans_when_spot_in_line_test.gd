## G16, the replan: a frag that rolls on a few px after the NPC planned its way clear, by a doorway,
## can bring the planned spot into the burst's line. The plan is made again then, however short the
## roll (`AgentGrenades._still_safe`), and not only once the grenade has moved 48 px
## (`REPLAN_DIST`). A defender in the living room by the kitchen's doorway is in the line of a frag
## that comes to rest in the kitchen, and plans a spot out of it; the frag then rolls on, under 48
## px, to a point from which that spot is in its line (the test works the point out from the world:
## the wall rays of the burst's line, its danger zone the blast radius plus the NPC's
## `evade_margin`). The NPC plans again, to a spot out of the new line, before the burst.
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: the evade reflex, outside Von). Premises: the thrower is an invader
## puppet in the kitchen that cannot be killed, armed here with a frag (the test world keeps the
## default inventory); the roll is the resting grenade moved to the new point with the `grenade`
## rest event it posts on coming to rest (the NPC, turned away from the grenade as it runs, hears
## where it stopped).
