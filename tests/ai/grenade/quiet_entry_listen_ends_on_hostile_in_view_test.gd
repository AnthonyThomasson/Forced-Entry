## E17 as amended by issue #51 R17: a hostile in view ends a quiet stack's listen hold early. The
## stack of two with a stun at the back door takes the quiet ENTER (scripted Von, nothing
## suspected), and its point holds in its slot to listen (`Listen.LISTEN`, 3 s). A second into the
## hold a householder stands in the doorway, in the point's view (on the line from its slot through
## the middle of the doorway): within `ENDS` s the point is no longer holding in its slot to listen,
## long before the hold would have run out.
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet that cannot be killed and never shoots, put in the doorway
## a second into the hold (a defender showing itself); the invaders are armed with one stun each at
## the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
