## G17: the shots' origin group (shot at by someone unseen from a room the NPC is outside of,
## GRENADE where the shots came from) uses throw spots too. An invader with a frag stands outside
## the Terrace house's back door, against the kitchen's east wall north of it (where a stack's slot
## is). A shot from inside the kitchen comes out through the doorway and lands beside it; nobody is
## seen. From where it stands no point of the shots' line inside the kitchen has a clear lob (the
## wall beside the door is in the way), and LOCATE is not offered toward a room the shots came from;
## GRENADE is offered through a throw spot in front of the doorway: the invader steps there and
## throws the frag into the kitchen, where the shots came from.
##
## The whole pipeline runs with real Von. `require`s come first: the shot registered and the
## invader's line back from it runs into the kitchen, and from where it stood no point of that line
## in the kitchen (past the threshold: `INSIDE` px in) has a clear lob in range (550 px, the throw
## range). The check is on the first decision, made where it was shot at: without a throw spot it
## would offer RETREAT alone, and a throw would follow only if the spot it retreated to happened to
## have a lob.
##
## Premises: the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired (as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts
## gunfire), posted first thing in `run` so it is in the invader's first decision; it lands 125 px
## from the invader, its direction the line from a spot inside the kitchen out through the doorway
## (clear of both jambs, so a bullet could have come that way). The invader is armed with one frag
## at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
