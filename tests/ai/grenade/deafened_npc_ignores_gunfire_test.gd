## G15, deaf: a deafened NPC hears no gunfire, hits elsewhere or radio callouts. Two defenders in
## the terrace house hear a shot fired in the kitchen: the one that can hear goes to investigate
## (the control), the one deafened by a bang remembers no gunfire and does not. Real Von; everything
## else is on.
##
## Premises: the gunfire is one shot heard from the kitchen (a `hit` event with nobody known behind
## it, as tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it); the deafness is `take_stun(0, 8)` on one
## defender, as a bang's would be (the grenade's own bang is tested elsewhere). No behaviour is
## switched off: the only characters are the two household defenders, allies of each other, so
## trespass hostility (a stranger in the house) has nobody to fall on and the shot is the only thing
## that can draw them.
