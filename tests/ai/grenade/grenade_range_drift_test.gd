## G17: the GRENADE tactic is offered against a spot within throw range (550 px) of where the NPC
## stood when the snapshot was made. The NPC moves on while Von answers, so by the time the order is
## adopted it can stand a few px past the range. It must not give the throw up there and re-decide
## (the tactic then flaps in and out of the offer near the range); the thrower closes the last few
## px on the spot and throws. One mechanism, scripted Von that answers slowly (30 physics frames a
## level): the invader starts 540 px from a hostile hidden behind a desk and is moved 20 px back, to
## 560 px, while its first question is in flight. GRENADE is asked about and carried out once, and
## the grenade leaves the hand within range.
