## E17 as amended by issue #51 R16: a member of a bang stack leaving for a fight does not cancel the
## bang. From the bang call until the stun leaves its hand the thrower is committed to the bang: a
## hostile seen on its walk out to the throw spot or in the wind-up does not make it leave; it
## throws, then fights from where it stands. The members still at the door go in on the burst (R8).
## The matches showed bang stacks breaking up instead: a defender seen in the doorway, the members
## leave for COMBAT, the thrower too on its way out, and no stun goes in.
##
## Three invaders, each with a stun, in the Terrace house's back garden north-east of the back door;
## gunfire is heard in the kitchen, so the stack goes for the kitchen by a bang (G18). The moment
## the thrower calls the bang, a householder stands just inside the doorway, at a spot the point and
## the thrower see from their slots and the front of the doorway (where the thrower throws from)
## does, but the third member's slot does not. The point leaves for the fight; the thrower,
## committed since its call, walks out with the householder in view and still throws: the planned
## stun goes off in the kitchen within `KEPT` s of the call, and a member still at the door at the
## burst goes in on it within `BANG_WINDOW` s. Then the thrower fights: the sighting it held off for
## the bang is decided once the stun has left its hand (a COMBAT order within `FIGHT` s of the
## release), not dropped. The householder steps back out of the doorway once the stun is thrown (so
## the crossing is not blocked by a body that cannot be killed).
##
## The whole pipeline runs with real Von. `require`d first: the stack claimed the back door in bang
## mode, a member left the stack for COMBAT before the stun left the thrower's hand, the bang was
## called, and the thrower had the householder in view `LEAD` s or more before the release.
##
## Premises: the gunfire is a `hit` event nobody known fired, inside the kitchen (as
## tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts it), first thing in `run`; the householder is a puppet that
## cannot be killed and never shoots, put in the doorway at the bang call and walked back out once
## the stun is thrown (a defender showing itself, timed against the stack); the invaders are armed
## with one stun each at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn; the stun's wind-up is held
## to `WINDUP` s (from 0.3). Von answers the sighting about 0.7 to 1.2 s after it, and from a
## thrower's own slot the walk out and a 0.3 s wind-up take about 1.25 s: the point's answer then
## came in a tenth of a second before the release, or after it, and the thrower's often during the
## wind-up, which already holds a throw (its answer dropped, so a run passed without the walk out
## being held at all). With the longer wind-up the point leaves well before the release, and a
## thrower whose answer comes during the wind-up must still act on it after the release.
