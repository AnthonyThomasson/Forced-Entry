## G17 / G18 (`docs/grenades.md`): the room a shot came from is the one behind the doorway it came
## through, not the room it landed in. An invader in the Terrace house's kitchen is shot at from the
## living room, through the doorway between them; it then steps into the hall. The line back from
## the shot (`shot_from`) starts where the shot landed, in the kitchen, and runs back through the
## doorway into the living room: the living room is where the shots came from, the kitchen is only
## where the invader stood. From the hall, its snapshot words the living room's entry as "shots at
## you came from there" and the kitchen's without it, and a GRENADE where the shots came from aims
## into the living room (a lob through the hall's doorway into it), never into the kitchen.
##
## Scripted Von (one mechanism: what the snapshot says and offers; the pick is RETREAT, which the
## test does not follow). Premises: the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired (as
## tests/_ai/investigate_probe.gd posts gunfire), landing beside the invader; once it has been taken
## in, the invader is moved into the hall (it "steps" there), and it is held still (`speed` 0) and
## decides every 0.4 s, so the snapshots read are made where it was put (`speed` 0 and a 0.4 s
## commit and tactic cadence, as `flank_probe.npc` holds an NPC); it carries a stun and a frag,
## armed the way Main arms a spawn.
