## G17, the `throw` primitive: the lob is checked again when the order is adopted (the NPC decided
## on a snapshot of a moment ago). One that is blocked by then is given up before the grenade is
## taken in hand: nothing is thrown before the NPC has re-decided, and Von is asked again. One
## mechanism, scripted Von that answers slowly (30 physics frames a level): the invader has a clear
## lob onto a hostile hidden behind a desk when GRENADE is offered; a wardrobe (coverage 95, over a
## lob's clearance) is put on the line while its question is in flight. The re-decision may offer
## GRENADE again through a throw spot round the wardrobe (issue #51 R13): a throw that follows
## leaves from at least 40 px from where the invader stood when it gave the first one up, with a
## clear lob.
