## G18 / E17, the second fallback: the thrower of a bang entry has lost its stun by the time it gets
## to throw (it is not in its hand to take: the throw fails). The bang is given up, nothing is
## thrown, the rest of the stack, holding its slot turned away from the door for the bang, is told
## over the radio (the claims say `bang` false) and goes in quietly without waiting out
## `BANG_BURST_CAP`. Scripted Von (SEARCH > STUN ENTRY > the back door); both invaders carry a stun,
## the way Main arms a spawn; the test takes the thrower's stun away the moment it radios `bang`.
