## E17 as amended by issue #51 R17: coming under fire ends a quiet stack's listen hold early. The
## stack of two with a stun at the back door takes the quiet ENTER (scripted Von, nothing
## suspected), and its point holds in its slot to listen (`Listen.LISTEN`, 3 s). A second into the
## hold a shot lands beside the point, from out in the garden (not from the kitchen, so the room
## does not become suspect): within `ENDS` s the point is no longer holding in its slot to listen,
## long before the hold would have run out.
##
## Premises: the shot is one `hit` event nobody known fired, landing beside the point, its direction
## from the garden east of it; the invaders are armed with one stun each at the start of `run`, the
## way Main arms a spawn.
