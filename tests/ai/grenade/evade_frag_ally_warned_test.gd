## G16, the radio: an ally that can neither see nor hear the grenade but is in its zone moves on a
## teammate's `grenade` callout. Two defenders in the hall of the terrace house; a hostile invader
## at the west end throws a frag that lands beside the first. The second sits on a chair at the
## hall's east end, about 340 px from the landing, in its line of sight and inside the frag zone
## (blast radius 250 + the 120 px evade margin), but outside `hear_grenade` (300 px) and with its
## back to the landing. It can only learn of the grenade from the call, and the reflex has to break
## off its interaction.
##
## Premises: the thrower is an invader *puppet* that cannot be killed (the scripted world event),
## armed here as Main arms a spawn; and the second defender is busy in an interaction (seated,
## started through `interact_with` at the start of `run`), which is what keeps a defender in place
## in a live house, where an idle one otherwise sets off to search a room within a third of a
## second. A premise check reads where B sat when A radioed and where the grenade really came to
## rest, so a different set-up is a finding.
