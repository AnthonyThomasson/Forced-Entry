## E17 as amended by issue #51 R17 with R11: footsteps heard while a quiet stack with a stun listens
## at the stack turn the entry into a bang before the point has started the pie. The stack of two at
## the back door takes the quiet ENTER (scripted Von, nothing suspected); a second after the point
## is in its slot, a householder walks up and down just inside the kitchen's east wall north of the
## door, out of sight of the stack and within earshot. The point is still in its slot when the steps
## are heard: the claims turn to bang, the bang is called and a stun goes off in the kitchen before
## anyone goes in, and the point never sliced the pie before the bang was called.
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet that cannot be killed and never shoots, walked to and fro
## (a defender moving about the kitchen) from the moment the point has stood in its slot a second;
## the invaders are armed with one stun each at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
