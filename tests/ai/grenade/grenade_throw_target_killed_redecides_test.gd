## G17, a throw order whose target dies on the way: the order keeps its spot when the contact it was
## offered on ages out on the way, but not when that hostile is dead. Killed while the thrower walks
## to its throw spot, the target leaves what the NPC knows, the NPC decides again at once and no
## grenade is thrown onto the body. The Terrace house, bare; the premise is
## `grenade_throw_spot_round_wall`'s (an invader with a stun outside the back door sees a household
## puppet in the kitchen, is moved behind the kitchen's east wall while its first question is in
## flight, and that question fails), so its first decision is a GRENADE through a throw spot at the
## back doorway, which it walks to.
##
## Other premises: the puppet never shoots, so no shots' origin is left to throw at once it is dead;
## it is killed with `take_damage` the first frame the invader is walking to the throw spot; the
## invader is armed at the start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
