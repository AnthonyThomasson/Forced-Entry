## G17's throw spots: GRENADE is also offered when the hostile is out of range from where the NPC
## stands, if a reachable throw spot exists; the `throw` primitive walks there first, then throws.
## The case the matches showed most (the target 450 to 700 px off across a doorway into the next
## room): an invader with a frag in the Terrace house's kitchen, by its east wall, sees a
## householder holding the living room through the doorway between them, about 650 px away: out of
## range from where the invader stands (550 px, the throw range), so GRENADE (a defender in a room
## the invader is outside of) is not offered from there; it is offered through a throw spot nearer
## the doorway: the invader walks there, throws the frag into the living room onto the householder
## from within range, and the blast catches it.
##
## The whole pipeline runs with real Von. `require`s come first: the invader fought the householder
## from the kitchen, and its first COMBAT decision against it was made from out of throw range (so
## the offer, if any, was through a throw spot, not R7's in place).
##
## Premises: the householder is a puppet that cannot be killed and never shoots (a defender that
## holds the room whatever is fired at it); the invader is armed with one frag at the start of
## `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
