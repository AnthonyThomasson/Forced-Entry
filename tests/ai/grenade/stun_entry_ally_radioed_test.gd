## G18 as amended (issue #51, R6): a room an ally radioed a hostile or a fight in is suspect. An
## ally in the hall is fighting a householder it sees in the kitchen through the hall door, and says
## so on the radio; the stack of two invaders, both carrying a stun, at the kitchen's back door
## (which cannot see the householder) takes STUN ENTRY into the kitchen, not the quiet ENTER. The
## whole pipeline runs with real Von for the stack; a `require` that it went for the kitchen by its
## back door comes first.
##
## Premises: the ally is a puppet whose radio call is posted first thing in `run` (a call that lands
## before the stack decides, as in a match where the fight started first: an NPC's own call would
## come only once Von has answered it, after the stack's first decision, and a call forces no
## re-decision). It is shaped as `GoalController._post_callout` sends an ENGAGE from where it
## stands, plus the `target_pos` every combat call is to carry (the hostile's last-known spot, issue
## #51). The householder is a puppet in the kitchen's north-east corner, hidden from every spot
## outside the back door; unkillable, it never shoots. Both invaders are armed with a stun at the
## start of `run`, the way Main arms a spawn.
