## G17: an invader with only a stun grenade, a hostile hidden from its line of fire behind a sofa in
## a hall, flashes it and then closes in while it is blind: after a stun the tree naturally goes on
## to ADVANCE or ENGAGE. The whole pipeline runs, real Von at every level. A `require` that the AI
## took the GRENADE path comes first, so a different Von choice reads as a set-up finding.
##
## The sofa stands against one wall of the hall and leaves a lane along the other, so the hostile
## can be reached and shot once it is passed. The hall is 140 px deep so that the lane is walkable
## in the navmesh (in a 100 px one the sofa seals it: the way to the hostile is then a 1500 px loop
## outside the house, and the "closes in" below passes or fails on how far round that loop the
## invader got). Premises: the hostile is a household *puppet* that cannot be killed and never
## shoots; the invader is armed with one stun here because the test world keeps the default
## inventory, the way Main arms a spawn.
