## The catalogue's run-down cyberpunk rooms and flats (R11, R12). No floorplan luxury_home,
## family_home, dining_house or cottage, and no room type kids_room, entry_hall or dining_room, is
## left in the catalogue, the arrangements, the recipes or LayoutRules. The four cyberpunk room
## types, the netrunner den (a dead-end private room), the ripperdoc (a through room), the security
## vestibule (may carry the front door) and the kitchenette, each have LayoutRules rows and links, a
## recipe and pieces of their own (each spawnable, with sane stats); and the three flats, the
## railroad flat, the micro-flat (a studio, a bathroom and a kitchenette) and the corner flat (a
## short inner hallway and a vestibule), between them use every one of those room types, each room
## of them furnished with its own pieces. That every floorplan passes
## LayoutRules and is walkable is house_doorways_connected's check, which covers the new flats with
## every other plan.
