## R7 (ticket #61): World-Gen places streetlights along the front sidewalk of every house, about 260
## px apart (each jittered by up to 50 px), never within 140 px of a front or exit doorway's centre
## nor in the strip straight out of one (the doorway's width plus 32 px each side, 400 px out); a
## lamp that would break that rule is dropped, so only a doorway's no-lamp zone can open a wider gap
## in the row. Each is a solid, anchored metal post (coverage 100, penetration 85: it blocks
## bullets) carved into the nav map. Checked for every floorplan over several seeds.
##
## It reads the lamps through (interface 1, beside `get_clutter` / `get_street`):
## - `WorldGen.get_streetlights(house) -> Array` of `{ pos, node }`: one entry per streetlight,
##   `pos` its centre in world space, `node` the placed piece (a descendant of the house, so the nav
##   bake carves it).
