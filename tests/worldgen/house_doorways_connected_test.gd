## another on the baked nav map, each doorway can be passed through, and every room is reachable
## from outside the front entrance; and LayoutRules.check finds nothing illogical in it (front door
## in a living space on the south wall, legal exits and doors, bathrooms are dead ends, no
## pass-through rooms) and it has at most one exit. The layout (rooms, doorways, exits) depends only
## on the plan and the seed's mirror draw, never on the furnishing, so these checks share the houses
