## R5 (ticket #61): wear and clutter are placed in the world per room, never baked into a repeating
## tile. In generated houses (the test's own house world plus more seeds, so several plans): each
## room has 0 to 3 wear clusters and 0 to 2 clutter pieces, no clutter kind twice in a room; clutter
## is non-solid decor (no collider on PhysicsLayers.SOLID, not carved into the nav map); every wear
## cluster and clutter piece sits by a wall, a corner or a piece of solid furniture of its room; the
## wear is drawn by a layer of its own per room; most rooms are worn and clutter shows up; and two
## rooms of the same type never get the same wear layout.
##
## It reads them through (interface 1, like `get_rooms` / `get_openings`):
## - `WorldGen.get_wear(house) -> Array` of `{ room, pos, layer }`: one entry per wear cluster,
##   `room` its room's key, `pos` its centre in world space, `layer` the node that draws that room's
##   wear.
## - `WorldGen.get_clutter(house) -> Array` of `{ room, key, node }`: one entry per clutter piece,
##   `key` its catalogue key, `node` the placed piece.

## The test world's own house.
