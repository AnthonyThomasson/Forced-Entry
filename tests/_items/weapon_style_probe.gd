## Shared by the weapon-style tests (ticket #61, R3): how a gun or grenade is DRAWN in a weapon
## style, read through the published `Item.drawn_art()` (the textures the item's last `draw_weapon`
## / `draw_dropped` painted, like `CharacterVisuals.drawn_art()`). Art is cached by what it depicts,
## so two items drawn alike paint the very same textures and a changed look new ones: a drawing is
## compared as the set of its textures' instance ids.
## An item is drawn on a `DrawProbe` (a plain `Node2D` of the test's whose `_draw` calls the item's
## published `draw_weapon(canvas, user)` or `draw_dropped(canvas, at, angle, modulate, opts)`), one
## probe per item, since `drawn_art` is its last draw only. Not a test
## (`const StyleProbe := preload(...)`).
