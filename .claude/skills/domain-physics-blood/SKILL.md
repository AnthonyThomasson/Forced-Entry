description: Deep implementation detail for the Physics blood sub-domain (scenes/physics/blood/) — a wound's spray and drips (BloodWound), splatters (BloodSplat), a dead body's bleed-out pool and its flood-fill flow (BloodPool, BloodFlow, BloodSurface), and blood that is carried (BloodField wetness, BloodDecals, BloodFootprints, BloodSmear), all tuned by BloodConfig and its topic holders (the Blood*Config family). Use when editing scenes/physics/blood/ or working on blood splatter, drips, pools, footprints, smears, floor-steered flow, or the Blood*Config tuning. Complements the `domain-physics` overview and the `architecture` skill (interface 4).

# Physics · Blood sub-domain (`scenes/physics/blood/`)

Self-contained and separate from debris / deformation: `blood_config, blood_field, blood_decals, blood_splat, blood_pool,
blood_pool_visuals, blood_flow, blood_smear, blood_footprints, footfall, blood_wound, blood_spawner, blood_throw, blood_surface`. The rest of
`physics/` (hit packet, knockback, deformation, debris, hit particles, ragdoll) reaches it only through `Physics.spawn_debris`
(a hit that carries blood; the bloody mark a bullet's `HitInfo.blood` leaves on an object is drawn by the core's
`Deformation.draw_marks`) and `Physics.bleed_out`; every other domain meets it through the classes in interface 4, all
resolved by `class_name`. It imports nothing outside Physics except `Despawner`, `DrawLayers` and `FillBatch` (General).

**Master switches** (`BloodConfig.enabled`, and under it `BloodPrintConfig.footprints_enabled` / `BloodSmearConfig.enabled`,
`BloodSurfaceConfig.surface_flow`): off, `BloodWound.record` /
`Physics.bleed_out` spawn nothing (`bleed_out` returns null); used by the Testing domain's `physics.blood` switch. `BloodSpawner` adds each
splatter and pool with a readable name (`BloodSplat`, `BloodSplat2`, … / `BloodPool`, …) so observers can tell them apart.
`BloodConfig` is a `class_name` static holder (the master switch, the colours, the draw layers, the decal layer's cap and
drying), beside one per topic: `BloodDripConfig`, `BloodSprayConfig`, `BloodSplatConfig`, `BloodPoolConfig`,
`BloodSurfaceConfig`, `BloodPrintConfig`, `BloodSmearConfig`, `BloodSmearLookConfig` and `BloodTrailConfig`; `PhysicsConfig.wall_mask` is the
layer the splat clipping and flow queries treat as blocking.

Three parts: a wound's **spray** (`BloodSprayConfig`), its **drips** (`BloodDripConfig`), and a dead body's **bleed-out**
(`BloodPoolConfig`).

- `BloodWound` (`class_name`, a Node the character composes like `Knockback`; the character's `take_hit` calls `record`): `record(hit)` throws
  `ceil(damage / hit_splat_damage)` splatters (max `hit_splat_max`) out the wound's exit side at once (plus one out the exit
  wound) and merges them side by side: each is begun as it is thrown (`BloodSpawner.splat(parent, at, throw: BloodThrow, whole = false)`, `blood_throw.gd`:
  `size`, `direction`, `energy`, `exclude` →
  `BloodSplat.begin`: its random shapes and wall rays on the main thread, in `setup`'s order; its outlines merged by the same
  fold, `_fold`, on a worker thread; its wet highlight added and its drying started at once) and `record` returns without
  waiting for the merges: `BloodSplat.defer_finish` finishes them (`finish`: waits for the merge, registers the splat with the
  `BloodField` aged from the physics frame it was begun on, draws it) in one deferred call later in the frame, before it is drawn,
  so the rest of the frame's work runs beside them (waiting cost ~0.9 ms a frame under heavy fire, #78). Nothing sees a splat
  half-built: `BloodField.wetness_at` first finishes every pending splat (`BloodSplat.finish_pending`), and a splat freed before
  its finish waits for its task as it leaves the tree. The splats are the ones `setup` builds whole
  (`tests/physics/blood_spray_side_by_side_matches_whole_test.gd` throws the same seeded hits both ways;
  `blood_spray_does_not_wait_test.gd` checks `record` returns with merges running, that a read or the frame's end finishes them, and
  their age; `spray_side_by_side` off builds each whole). A drip is still built whole (`setup`). Then it adds
  `ceil(damage * drips_per_damage)` to a drip budget (cap `max_pending_drips`). While it lasts, one drop falls
  every random `BloodDripConfig.interval_min..max` s (3..10) from the host's `blood_origin()`; it keeps the host's
  `velocity` for `BloodDripConfig.fall_time`, so a walker's drops land ahead and splat stretched along its heading
  (`energy` = speed / `BloodDripConfig.full_energy_speed`). `stop()` on death ends dripping. Each body keeps at most
  `max_splats_per_body` splatters (oldest freed); the global `Despawner` cap applies too.
- `BloodSplat` (`blood_splat.gd`, built by `BloodSpawner.splat`, named `BloodSplat`, `Despawner`-tracked,
  colliderless): one impact, built once in `setup(radius, direction, energy, exclude)` and then static. A lumpy
  core stretched along the throw, tapered crown spikes (forward ones longer with energy; some throw a tail
  droplet), and satellite droplets, all clipped by walls/furniture (a ray from the centre, `PhysicsConfig.wall_mask`)
  and merged (`Geometry2D.merge_polygons`, skipped for two outlines whose boxes are apart — the union would keep them as two;
  `tests/physics/blood_splat_merge_fast_path_test.gd` pins the build to the merge-against-every-outline one) into opaque outlines
  so overlaps don't darken, drawn as one General `FillBatch` (under the headless display, which renders nothing, one
  `draw_colored_polygon` each, as `FillBatch.batching` is off there). Each outline is
  run through `BloodSplat.drawable` once built: about 1 splat in 100,000 unions into a polygon the engine
  cannot triangulate, which is swapped for its convex hull (or dropped) instead of logging an error when drawn.
  Test: `tests/physics/blood_splat_shapes_valid_test.gd`. A wet highlight fleck
  fades and the colour dries to `dried_color` over `BloodSplatConfig.dry_time`. Shape knobs: `BloodSplatConfig`, `BloodDripConfig.size_min` / `size_max`.
- Bleed-out: `Physics.bleed_out(parent, source, exclude)` (`BloodSpawner.bleed`) starts a dead body's pool where
  its blood leaves it (`blood_origin()`: the trunk's middle once fallen): a `BloodPool` holding
  `BloodPoolConfig.bleed_out_cells` grid cells claimed by a `BloodFlow` flood-fill: cheapest-first with
  noise-roughened cost (`flow_*` tuning), cells overlapping a `PhysicsConfig.wall_mask` collider never fill, so the
  puddle is one continuous irregular shape wrapping around walls and furniture. All cells are claimed up front (a
  batch per frame); a front then sweeps through flow-cost over `bleed_out_duration`, so each cell's fill rises
  continuously. Drawn by blurring the fill field into a small image and thresholding it in a shader (one smooth
  outline, darker rim), every physics frame while it spreads; the 3x3 box blur adds each cell's three-cell row sums (doubles: a sum
  of float32 fills is exact, so the field is the nine-cell loop's, `tests/physics/blood_pool_blur_matches_plain_test.gd`).

The floor steers the flow: each cell's step cost is multiplied by `BloodSurface.resistance(world_pos)` —
surfaces (Objects' floors) register a world rect + a `groove` Callable, so blood runs cheaply along grooves
(`groove_resist`), slowly across smooth surface (`smooth_resist`) and slowest over a porous surface
(`porous_resist`: carpet floors and rugs); outdoors = 1. Newest-registered surface wins on overlap, except
that any porous surface at a point counts (`BloodSurface.is_porous`), so a rug over tile is porous whichever
registered first. Master switch `BloodSurfaceConfig.surface_flow`.

**Soaking.** Blood on a porous surface sinks in: once the flood has mostly reached a porous cell (>= 0.5),
`BloodFlow.tick(delta)` (called from `BloodPool`, which keeps processing after the front settles while
`soaking()`) takes its soak 0 -> 1 over `soak_time`. Soaking never changes `fill(c)` or the pool's outline: the blood
still covers everything it covered, with no holes; it turns translucent (`soak_opacity`) so the carpet or rug pattern shows through it. `wetness(c)` = `fill * (1 - soak)` is what
`BloodField.wetness_at` reads, so soaked blood leaves no prints or smears. Dragged-out trail cells are not soaked.
**Slower, shorter and tufted:** `BloodFlow.advance` stretches the sweep by `porous_spread_slowdown` in proportion to the share of
claimed cells on porous surface, so blood creeps over carpet; and each porous cell costs `porous_cell_weight` cells of the
bleed-out budget (`BloodFlow.budget_used`, `step(..., budget)`), so the pool does not travel as far. The pool texture is RG8 (red = `fill(c)`, green =
`soak_level(c)`, only written when `has_porous()`); the shader splits the pool into irregular `soak_tuft_size` px tufts
fixed to the pool, each with its own soak rate (`soak_tuft_spread` wide) and its own shade of red (`soak_tuft_contrast`, kept subtle), plus a
faint crease where tufts meet. Only colour and opacity change, so some tufts are still bright while others have gone dull. Tests: `blood_soaks_into_carpet`, `blood_soaks_into_rug`.

## Footprints and smears (blood that is carried)

A carrier soaks up a *load* (0..1) of wet blood where it touches it and deposits it with the load fading,
so trails taper. Tuning: `BloodPrintConfig` (`footprints_enabled`, `pickup_gain`,
`thick_blood`, `pool_wet_time`, `splat_wetness`, the prints), `BloodSmearConfig` (`enabled`, the fingers, the drag),
`BloodSmearLookConfig` (a ribbon's look) and `BloodTrailConfig` (blood pulled out of a pool).
- `BloodField` (static): `wetness_at(world_pos) -> 0..1` (finishing every splat still pending first). `BloodSplat.setup` (or
  `finish`, aged from `begin`'s frame) and `BloodPool.seed_bleed_out` register themselves (spatial hash for splatters, a list for
  pools; entries drop on `tree_exited`). A
  splatter is a thin film (`splat_wetness`) drying to 0 over `BloodSplatConfig.dry_time`; a pool is its flow fill, wet for
  `pool_wet_time`. Dried blood returns 0. Ages count physics frames.
- `BloodDecals` (one per parent via `layer(parent)` / `find(parent)`; extends Physics' `chunked_layer.gd`, `domain-physics`): batches prints
  (polygons, each run of them one General `FillBatch`) and smear ribbons at `BloodConfig.print_z_index` in the shared chunked store, whose chunks redraw only when they gain a mark or a
  ribbon grows (and, its own chunk draw, at 2 Hz while drying, `print_dry_time`); its cap is `print_max` (not the Despawner).
  `ribbon_begin(point, width, alpha) -> mark`, `ribbon_extend(mark, point, width, alpha)` (width 0 = taper to a
  point), `ribbon_count()`; a ribbon is drawn as two quads per segment via `draw_primitive`, solid on its centre line
  and fading to `BloodSmearLookConfig.feather` at the edges. `items()` / `print_count()` for tests. `print_at` drops polygons the
  engine can't triangulate.
- `BloodFootprints` (Node child of a walker): `step(foot, fall: Footfall)` per footfall (`footfall.gd`: `at`, `direction`, `length`, `width`, `inner`, `speed`; the character's `character_footsteps.gd` calls it). Per foot id: soak `max(load, wetness *
  pickup_gain)` (sampled heel/middle/toe), stamp a mirrored sole (heel, arch on the `inner` side, ball, toe) with
  alpha from the load unless already in thick blood, then lose `BloodPrintConfig.decay`. Low load = thin arch + rough edge;
  speed and load slip the print forward.
- `BloodSmear` (Node child of a RigidBody2D): `set_footprint(local polygon)` lays a grid of "fingers" fixed to the
  body; while `linear_velocity` > `BloodSmearConfig.min_speed` each finger soaks blood under it and every
  `BloodSmearConfig.segment_length` px extends its ribbon: width `BloodSmearLookConfig.width` x spacing x sqrt(load), alpha from load, the
  centre line wandering on smooth noise (`BloodSmearLookConfig.wobble`, `BloodSmearLookConfig.wobble_freq`) so streaks drift and cross. Load falls
  by `BloodSmearConfig.decay_per_px`; below `BloodSmearConfig.break_load` the ribbon breaks into dry-brush dashes; where it ends (rest,
  no load) it tapers to a point. Per-finger variation makes streaks end and thicken unevenly.
  **Blending into the puddle:** a finger lays a ribbon even over blood already there, but the ribbon is
  see-through where the floor is wet (`BloodSmearLookConfig.absorb_lo..hi` on `BloodField` wetness), eases in over its first
  `BloodSmearLookConfig.fade_in` px, and its opacity may only rise `BloodSmearLookConfig.alpha_rise` per sample, so the streak swells out of a
  splatter's crisp edge or a pool's soft rim with no start line (`thick_blood` gates footprints only).
  **Pulled out of a pool:** a finger carrying >= `smear_trail_min` load within `smear_trail_reach` px of a pool calls
  `BloodPool.drag_out(pos, load x smear_trail_gain)`, which adds `BloodFlow.trail` cells (3x3, max-merged, capped at
  `pool_trail_max`, level tapering to 0 at `pool_trail_length` px (50) from the flooded cells = how far a pool can be dragged; `fill(c)` = max(flood, trail), `covers(c)`). The pool's own visuals draw the trail, so the pool's
  outline stretches into a tongue of the same colour, rim and edge that tapers as the load decays, and the ribbons
  continue as the wispy tail (`BloodField.pool_near(pos, radius)` finds the pool; wetness includes the trail).
- Tests: `tests/physics/footprints_*`, `object_smear*` (incl. `object_smear_pool`), `smear_ribbon_shape`, `blood_pool_trail`, `blood_field_query`, `blood_decals_cap`.

**Draw order.** All blood lies at `DrawLayers.BLOOD` (−3, General's ladder, interface 11): `BloodConfig.z_index` (a `BloodSplat`;
a `BloodPool` node itself, set by `BloodSpawner._new_pool`, so its `BloodPoolVisuals` child draws there and the pool as a whole sits on
blood's rung) and `print_z_index` (the `BloodDecals` prints and smears, and Physics' scorch decals). Over the floor (−5) and rugs (−4),
under what lies there (a dead body, casings, a dropped item, `LYING` −2) and so under a vehicle driving over it.

**Interfaces:** 4 (Objects / Character → Physics), 11 (`DrawLayers.BLOOD`; `FillBatch`: the splats and the prints) — signatures in `architecture`.
