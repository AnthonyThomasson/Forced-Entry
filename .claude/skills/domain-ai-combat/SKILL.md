description: Deep implementation detail for the AI COMBAT module (scenes/ai/behavior/combat.gd) — how an NPC fights with its hands: taking a shot (fire cooldown, dry-gun click, automatic bursts, backing off a gun whose barrel is against a wall), throwing a punch, the peek-and-cover cycle (peek to a clear-shot spot, fire, duck to cover) and its committed destination, the ambush, melee, fire-at-will on the move, the reload reflex, and the no-per-weapon-code rule. Use when editing scenes/ai/behavior/combat.gd or working on how NPCs shoot, reload, take cover or step back. Complements the `domain-ai-behavior` overview and the `architecture` skill.

# AI · Combat module (`scenes/ai/behavior/combat.gd`)

A `RefCounted` that `Behavior` owns (built in `setup()`, config copied in by `apply_config()`). It owns the fire cooldown and the
peek-and-cover cycle (`phase` `"peek"`/`"cover"`, `cover_timer`, `fire_timer`, the committed `dest` and `dest_timer`, the burst and
back-off counters) and executes every combat action on the character. `Behavior` decides WHICH fight is on — it holds the engaged
contact (node, last-known position) and the `hold_ground` flag — and passes them in each call, so combat never picks a target. It reads
the world only through the perception (`has_line_to`, `combat_spots`, `note_engaged`) and `Locomotion` (`move_to`, `inside_house`).

`bind(character)` (from `Behavior.bind`) hands it the NPC's body once; no other function takes the character. API: `tick(delta)`
(cooldown), `begin_fight()` (reset to the peek phase), `can_fire_at(target)` (a
loaded gun, the known contact in range on a clear line: a shot is on), `fire_at_will(target)`
(shoot it when `can_fire_at`, once facing settles; aims at it; the watch stage calls it for the threat in every primitive, `domain-ai-watch`), `reload_due()`, `has_line_of_fire(target) -> bool` (in range on a clear line, whatever the gun's state; what `can_fire_at` adds a loaded gun to, and the entry reads for E14), `top_off() -> bool` (a tactical reload of a part-spent gun, called by the entry at the stack: starts it, true while it runs or is wanted; `docs/tactical-entry.md` E11), `ambush(node, pos)`,
`peek_cover(delta, node, pos, hold_ground, room := "")`, `melee(pos, hold_ground)`, `shoot() -> bool`, `strike()` / `punch()` / `kick()`,
`continue_burst()`, `apply_back_off(delta)`, `reload_if_dry()`; `signal dry`
(an empty gun was pulled on — `Behavior` flags the task resolved so the controller re-decides). Tunables (copied from the controller
exports): `shoot_range`, `punch_range`, `combat_ring_radius` / `combat_ring_count` (the ring of candidate spots), `cover_time`,
`fire_cooldown`, `fire_burst`, `back_off_time`, `reposition_interval`, `auto_reload`.

**Peek-and-cover** (the `engage` primitive, style `peek_cover`): in the PEEK phase move to the nearest spot with a clear shot and
fire on `fire_cooldown`, then duck; in the COVER phase hold behind a shielding spot for `cover_time` (reloading an empty gun
meanwhile) before peeking again. Positions are committed for `reposition_interval`, not re-picked every frame, so the NPC steers
smoothly. A peek shoots only once the facing has settled on the contact (`AIM_TOLERANCE`) and ducks only after a shot left the barrel (or on the click
of an empty gun, where the cover phase reloads it), not after a refused one. **Ambush** holds the covered spot and fires the moment a line opens (facing settled). (`Combat.ambush` is the ENGAGE spot's stance;
the ordered `ambush` primitive, `docs/leadership.md` LD15, is not this module's: it is `Behavior._apply_defend`'s walk and hold at a post,
and its shots are the watch stage's, `domain-ai-behavior`.) **Melee** closes to `punch_range` and strikes on the
cooldown (no cover cycle): `Combat.strike` kicks (`Combat.kick`, `Character.leg_kick()`) while standing with a gun in hand, so the gun stays in hand,
and otherwise (crouched, or no gun held) equips the fists and punches (`Combat.punch`). With `hold_ground` (a territorial NPC fighting a contact outside), spots are restricted to inside
the house, the peek fallback holds instead of advancing, and melee won't chase out of the house. With a `room` (a member ordered to defend
it, `docs/leadership.md` LD8) the peek and cover spots are restricted to inside that room whatever the contact, and `hold_ground` is set
against a contact outside the room.

**No per-weapon code.** The behaviour never knows which gun it has. It fights with `Character.gun_slot()` (the held item if it takes ammo, else the
lowest slot that does) and reacts only to generic conditions the character reports: out of rounds, mid-reload, running, **blocked**, automatic.

**Firing** (`Combat.shoot() -> bool`, true = a round left the barrel; the fists are `Combat.punch`). It holds fire at a run or mid-reload (cooldown kept), and while `holds_fire()`: blind with `blind_fire` false, the orchestrator's one roll
as the NPC went blind (`Behavior.set_blind_fire`, `docs/grenades.md` G15), no trigger pulled at all, so no dry click, and `continue_burst` cuts a burst;
a dry gun is a click (below); otherwise it equips the gun and, **if `weapon_blocked()` (the barrel is against a wall or object), sets
`_back_off_timer = back_off_time`, keeps the cooldown and returns false**, else calls `shoot()` and, only on success, notes engagement and starts
the cooldown. `Behavior.apply()` ends each tick with `Combat.apply_back_off`: while the timer runs it overrides `move_input = -facing` (away from where the gun
points, less any part that heads into a body it knows of: `Locomotion.keep_off`) and clears `run_input`, so the NPC steps back until the
barrel is clear, then shoots. Callers that advance state on a shot (peek-and-cover
switching to its cover phase) wait for the back-off to finish. A pistol never reports blocked, so a chair against it changes nothing. An
`is_automatic()` gun's trigger pull is a **burst**: `_burst_left = fire_burst − 1` more rounds, fired from `Behavior.apply()` (`Combat.continue_burst`) as the gun's own
fire rate allows, ending early on a run, reload, wall or empty gun. Controller exports: `fire_burst` (3), `back_off_time` (0.45 s).
Tests: `tests/ai/combat/blocked_gun_steps_back_test.gd` (a rifle with a chair against its barrel), `pistol_fires_against_object_test.gd`.
Not modelled: a rifleman cornered with a wall behind it can still stall (bounded by the back-off timer and re-decisions); cover logic treats walls as
bulletproof though a rifle shoots through them.

**Throwing a grenade** (`begin_throw(slot, spot, reach, from := Vector2.INF)`, `throw_step(delta)`, `throw_released()`, `end_throw()`; `throw_stage` `""` / `"walk"` / `"aim"` / `"windup"` / `"away"`): the `throw` primitive's hands (`docs/grenades.md` G17), also used by the
bang entry's thrower (`ItemRegistry.STUN_SLOT`, or `FRAG_SLOT` for a stack its leader ordered in with a frag, `docs/leadership.md` LD14). `reach` is how far from the spot it lets go (`AgentPerception.grenade_reach`: the range less `AgentThrow.REACH_SLACK` 15 px). With a throw spot `from` (issue #51 R13) it first walks all the way to it (`"walk"`, `THROW_SPOT_REACH` 6 px: the lob was judged from there), the gun still in hand (the watch stage keeps its eyes and gun on a threat; the caller's commit timer and the locomotion's held walk bound the walk). Then standing still (but for the last few px: a thrower farther than `reach` from the spot, because it moved on since the spot was offered, walks toward it first, within the same `THROW_START_CAP`; the bang's thrower plans a spot already within the reach), it selects the grenade's slot (`select_slot`), aims at the spot (`aim_point`; the item throws to `Character.aim_target()`) and clicks `shoot()` once the facing has settled (`_faces`); `shoot()` answers true when the
throw STARTS (`GrenadeItem.secondary`), not for a round leaving a barrel. It never reads the contact: it throws onto the spot it was handed, and `Behavior` keeps the order (and so that spot) when the contact ages out on the way, and ends it (the NPC re-decides) when that hostile dies before the wind-up (G17). It gives up after `THROW_START_CAP` (2 s) without a start or `THROW_RELEASE_CAP` (1.5 s) without the grenade leaving the hand (`throw_step` returns `&"failed"`).
`throw_released` is true once, on the tick the carried count has dropped (the wind-up is over); it takes the gun back in hand (`select_slot(gun_slot())`, a last grenade empties its slot by itself). It is polled by `Behavior.poll_throw`
before the evade reflex gets its plan, since the grenade just thrown is a live one the thrower may be inside the zone of.

**Ammo.** An empty gun cannot fire, so the behaviour never "fights" with one: `Combat.fire_at_will` returns early when the gun
is empty or reloading, and `Combat.shoot()` on an empty gun is a dry click that does not note engagement or call `shoot()`; it spends
`fire_cooldown` and emits `dry` (the behaviour flags the task resolved), so the NPC re-decides (the snapshot now says the gun is empty) at most once per
cooldown. `auto_reload` (controller export, default on) is `Combat.reload_if_dry`, a reflex in `hold` (the server-down fallback, and after a
reload), in the cover phase of peek-and-cover and from the watch stage whenever a threat is in view outside a crossing (W3): an EMPTY gun with a spare magazine is reloaded without a decision. A reload
runs only while standing (running cancels it, so the `reload` primitive never sets `run_input`). `debug_state()` / `debug_combat()`
carry `reloading`; the combat overlay shows a RELOADING badge. Tests: `tests/ai/combat/scripted_reload_decision_test.gd`,
`dry_pistol_fallback_test.gd`, `empty_pistol_no_spares_test.gd`.
