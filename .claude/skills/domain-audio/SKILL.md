name: domain-audio
description: Deep implementation detail for the Audio domain (scenes/audio/) — the procedural sound system. Every sound is synthesized in code (SoundSynth recipes → AudioStreamWAV, cached by SoundBank), picked by profile (gun, material × outcome × round weight, floor surface × gait, vehicle kind × stage, crash material × speed band), and played by the `Sound` autoload through a capped pool of positional voices, with looping voices that follow a vehicle (engine, skid). Use when editing scenes/audio/, adding or retuning a sound (gunshots, bullet impacts, footsteps, reloads, grenades, vehicle engines, doors, skids and crashes), adding a material / surface / gun voice, changing how events map to sounds, voice limits or range, or asserting on sound in a test. Complements the `architecture` skill, which holds the cross-domain interfaces.

# Audio domain

A leaf, like Physics and Art: it imports nothing from other domains but General's `EventBus`. Other domains **post EventBus events**;
the `Sound` service (an autoload) listens and plays. There are no audio files: every sound is made by
`SoundSynth` from a recipe, so a new material or gun is a row in a table, not an asset.

```
gun.gd / projectile.gd / character*.gd / thrown_grenade.gd / explosion.gd / vehicle.gd ──EventBus──▶ Sound ─▶ SoundBank ─▶ SoundSynth ─▶ AudioStreamWAV
Sound ──(engine_state / slip / speed, duck-typed, each frame)──▶ the vehicle a loop follows

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `sound_config.gd` (`SoundConfig`) | Static tuning: `enabled` master switch, `master_db`, `category_db`, `category_voices`, `category_range`, `range_follows_zoom`, `pitch_jitter`, `volume_jitter_db`, `sample_rate` (22050), `peak`, `variants`, the `light_power_max` / `heavy_power_min` weight bands, `rng_seed`, `prewarm`, and the deafness tuning `muffle_cutoff_hz` / `muffle_open_hz` / `muffle_attack` / `muffle_release`, `tinnitus_tail` / `tinnitus_full_s`, and the vehicles' `engine_pitch` (0.85 idle .. 2.9 redline), `engine_load_db` 4, `engine_rev_db` 3, `skid_full_slip` 0.4, `skid_pitch` 0.18, `skid_full_speed` 200, `loop_ease` 14/s, `crash_medium_speed` 150 / `crash_heavy_speed` 280 (the crash bands) and `crash_speed_ref` 180. Categories are `shot`, `impact`, `footstep`, `reload`, the grenades' `throw`, `grenade`, `explosion`, `tinnitus` and the vehicles' `engine` (−9 dB, 4 voices, 1400 px, 1 variant), `vehicle` (−2 dB, 6, 1800 px) and `skid` (−7 dB, 3, 1600 px, 1 variant); per-category tables (`category_db`, `_voices`, `_range`, `_jitter_scale`, `_variants`). |
| `sound_synth.gd` (`SoundSynth`) | `render(recipe, seed) -> AudioStreamWAV`. Layers: `noise` (envelope, 2-pole low-pass, 1-pole high-pass), `tone` (gliding sine), `modes` (damped resonators = how a material rings), `pulses` (a periodic excitation, `rate` noise bursts a second, rounded to whole pulses per clip, each `burst` s long, its level cycling through `pattern` and nudged by `spread` / `jitter`, or continuous noise at `rate` 0; shaped by `lp` / `hp`, `noise` of it heard raw and the rest rung through resonators `freqs` / `amps` / `decays`, swelled by `wobble` [cycles per clip, depth]: an engine's firing, a tyre's squeal). Optional `vary` makes each seed its own take (every layer's gain, decay, cut-offs, delay and partials are nudged). Mix → optional `drive` (tanh) → normalize to `peak` → 4 ms fade → 16-bit mono. A `loop` recipe skips the fade and its stream loops over the whole clip; in a loop whatever a layer still sounds past the clip's end is folded back onto its start (`_at`), so decaying layers and pulses join without a seam (a steady tone must still be a whole number of cycles of the length). Same recipe + seed ⇒ same bytes. |
| `sound_bank.gd` (`SoundBank`) | The library. `*_profile(...)` name a sound without rendering it; `sound(profile, variant) -> { stream, level_db }` renders once and caches; `render(profile, variant)` renders without caching and touches nothing shared (a worker thread may call it), `file(profile, variant, entry)` caches a render unless that variant is cached already (main thread only), `is_cached`, `main_thread_renders` (how many sounds were synthesized on the main thread, for tests); `recipe_for`, `profiles()`, `clear_cache()`, `cached_count()`. Holds the `SHOTS`, `MATERIALS`, `FOOTSTEPS`, `RELOADS` tables, the grenades' `THROWS`, `GRENADE_BODIES`, `GRENADE_SURFACES`, `EXPLOSIONS`, and the vehicles' `VEHICLES` (per kind: `db`, the engine's firing `rate` / `pattern` / `burst` / `lp` / `noise` and exhaust `pipe` resonances, the starter's `crank`, the `door` pitch and weight, whether it has a `slide` door), `ENGINE_LOOP` (1 s), `DOOR_STAGES` and `CRASH_BANDS` (`light` / `medium` / `heavy`: `db`, `body`, `crunch`, `length`, `glass`, `debris`). |
| `sound_surface.gd` (`SoundSurface`) | Static floor registry (the `BloodSurface` pattern): `register(rect, material, pattern) -> id`, `unregister(id)`, `at(pos) -> StringName` (newest floor wins; none = `outdoor`: the street round a house registers no surface, so it is `outdoor` too), `surface_for(material, pattern)`. |
| `sound.gd` (autoload `Sound`) | The service: EventBus listener, variant/pitch/volume choice, range cull, voice pool, `&"sound"` announcements. `active(category)`, `reset()` (also ends every loop), static `reach_from(...)`; `focus` (a character node, Main sets the human) and `muffled()` (see "Deafness"); the vehicle loops and `loop_of(vehicle, kind) -> { profile, pitch, volume_db }` (`{}` when none; see "Vehicle loops"). |

## Profiles

A profile is a `StringName` that fully determines a sound, so tests can assert on it without rendering:

| Profile | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `shot/<gun>` | `pistol`, `smg`, `rifle`. An unknown gun borrows its band's recipe (light→smg, medium→pistol, heavy→rifle). |
| `impact/<material>/<outcome>/<band>` | outcome `blocked` (embedded), `penetrate` (went through), `ricochet`. |
| `impact/<material>/punch` | A fist; no band. |
| `footstep/<surface>/<walk\|run>` | surface `wood tile stone concrete carpet outdoor`. |
| `reload/<gun>/<out\|in>` | `out`: a dry release click. `in`: a seat click, then a rack click. Both quiet and short, no rings. Unknown gun borrows its band's. |
| `throw/<kind>` | `stun` / `frag`: the lever's metal ping and a rising whoosh (the frag's ping is higher and louder). |
| `grenade/<kind>/<surface>` | A bounce: the floor's thud and the crack of contact, the shell's ring as much as the floor leaves (tile, stone ring; carpet, outdoor swallow it), a smaller second tick. `<surface>` is the `SoundSurface.at` of the landing, the open ground for an unknown one. |
| `explosion/frag` | Big and low: a crack, the boom and a sub-bass, a roar and a rumble, debris pattering down; 0.97 s (a profile may not run past 1 s, `audio/bank`). |
| `explosion/stun` | Sharp, very loud (+3 dB trim, then the category's +3), bright (a ring of high partials) and over in 0.42 s. |
| `tinnitus/whine` | A seamless 0.8 s loop of three thin tones (4.3 kHz twice, 5 Hz apart so they beat, and 6.85 kHz). |
| `engine/<car\|van>` | A seamless 1 s loop: the firing train at idle (28 / 20 firings a second through a four-cylinder `pattern`), rung through the exhaust's resonances, with block hum and valve ticks. The service pitches it by the revs. The van's is deeper (larger, lower `pipe` resonances, slower firing). An unknown kind is voiced as a car. |
| `ignition/<kind>` | The starter cranking a few strokes (a geared whine slowing at each compression), then the engine catching, racing up and settling to idle; 0.98 s. |
| `door/<kind>/<open\|close>` | In a reload's register: dry mechanical clicks over a low thunk, no creak or ring. `open`: the handle's click, the latch letting go with a low knock, and the soft thump of the door coming off its seal. `close`: the slam (the door's weight thumping home with the body's low panels, 150 / 230 Hz), the latch clicking shut into it, a dull knock of the trim. The van's door is lower and heavier. |
| `door/van/<slide_open\|slide_close>` | Only a kind with a sliding door: the roll back on its runners into the stop, and the heavy thunk of it shutting with the catch clicking home (no panel ring). |
| `skid/tyre` | A seamless 1 s loop: the rubber's stick-slip ringing a few close pitches (about 1 to 2.7 kHz) that beat and swell, over a hiss. |
| `crash/<material>/<light\|medium\|heavy>` | A vehicle striking `material` (every `MATERIALS` entry; `wall` for `""`, `default` for an unknown one), the band by the closing speed (`SoundConfig.crash_medium_speed` / `crash_heavy_speed`): the vehicle's mass thumping home (a sub boom when heavy), sheet metal folding and ringing, the struck material's own crack and ring, glass and debris after a heavy one. `crash/flesh/<band>` is a character struck: a dull, heavy thud. |

- **Materials:** `wood metal glass ceramic composite stone plastic fabric foliage electronics flesh`, `wall` (what walls
  report as the empty material `""`) and `default` for anything unknown. `composite` is the helmet's (a dull, short knock: thump 0.55,
  modes 380 / 820 / 1450 Hz); a round armour stops posts the armour's material (`metal` steel, `ceramic`, `composite`, `fabric` the soft panels,
  `docs/outfits.md` O6), so it is heard as that and not as flesh.
- **Bands** come from the round's penetration power (`SoundBank.band`): `light` < 0.9 (SMG 0.8), `medium`
  (pistol 1.0), `heavy` ≥ 1.6 (rifle 2.2). Heavier = lower pitch, louder crack (−4 / 0 / +4 dB by band).
- A `hard` material (metal, glass, ceramic, composite, stone, electronics, wall) rings long on a ricochet and adds a falling
  whine; a soft one whips instead. Penetration adds a crunch, a hiss of air and a deeper thud. `thump` is how
  much low body a hit has (flesh and fabric thud, metal and glass do not). A material may also carry `heft` (metal 0.9): extra body gain, a longer thud and a quieter ring on a non-ricochet hit, so a round striking metal lands heavy.
- The synth normalizes every sound, so a quiet one says so with a `db` trim in its table row (carpet −6, fabric
  −4, a punch −6 …) which `SoundBank` folds into `level_db`.

## Events the service listens to

| Topic | Posted by | Payload (Audio reads) |
|---|---|---|
| `&"shot"` | `GunItem.secondary` (Items) | `position` (muzzle), `gun`, `power` (+ `attacker`) |
| `&"hit"` | `Projectile._deal` (Projectile), `Character._post_melee_hit` (Character: a punch or a kick), `Explosion` (Projectile: a frag's blast, outcome `blast`) | `position`, `outcome` (`blocked`/`penetrate`/`ricochet`/`punch`), `material`, `power`, `speed_factor`, `damage`. A hit without a `blocked` / `penetrate` / `ricochet` / `punch` outcome (none, or a blast's) is not a sound: the burst has its own. A fly-over posts nothing, so it is silent. |
| `&"footfall"` | `CharacterFootsteps._report` (Character) | `position` (the sole), `foot` (0 left / 1 right), `speed`, `running` |
| `&"reload"` | `Character._post_reload` (Character) | `position`, `gun`, `power`, `stage`: `start` → the `out` sound, `done` → the `in` sound; any other stage is silent. A cancelled reload never posts `done`. |
| `&"throw"` | `GrenadeItem._release` (Items) as the grenade leaves the hand, at the end of the windup | `position`, `kind` → `throw/<kind>` |
| `&"grenade"` | `ThrownGrenade._post` (Items) | `position`, `kind`, `stage`: `bounce` → `grenade/<kind>/<floor under it>`; `rest` is silent. |
| `&"explosion"` | `Explosion.frag` / `.stun` (Projectile) | `position`, `kind` → `explosion/<kind>`. The same event shakes the camera (General). |
| `&"stun"` | `Character.take_stun` (Character) | `character`, `deaf`, `position`: voiced only for the `focus` character and a `deaf` > 0 (the tinnitus). A blind-only stun, or another character's, is silent. |
| `&"vehicle"` | `vehicle.gd` (Vehicles) | `position`, `kind`, `stage`: `ignition` → `ignition/<kind>`; `door_open` / `door_close` / `slide_open` / `slide_close` → `door/<kind>/<open\|close\|slide_open\|slide_close>`; `crash` (+ `speed`, `material`) → `crash/<material>/<band>`, `bump_character` (+ `speed`) → `crash/flesh/<band>`, both louder within the band by `linear_to_db(clamp(speed / crash_speed_ref, 0.5, 1.6))`. Category `vehicle`. |
| `&"engine"` | `vehicle.gd` | `vehicle`, `kind`, `stage`: `start` starts the vehicle's `engine/<kind>` loop, `stop` ends it. |
| `&"skid"` | `vehicle.gd` | `vehicle`, `stage`: `start` starts its `skid/tyre` loop, `stop` ends it. |

It posts `&"sound"` `{ kind, profile, variant, position, volume_db, pitch }` for every sound it accepts. That is
what tests assert on (the runner records every bus event); nothing else listens.

## How a sound is played

1. `Sound._on_posted` returns at once when `SoundConfig.enabled` is off or the topic is not its own.
2. The event becomes a profile (`SoundBank.*_profile`; a footfall asks `SoundSurface.at(position)` for the floor).
3. Range: `reach_from(category, at, camera centre, zoom)` is 0 beyond `category_range` (scaled by `1/zoom` when
   `range_follows_zoom`). No camera = in range. The same number becomes the player's `max_distance`.
4. A variant is drawn from the service's **own RNG** (`rng_seed`; never the gameplay RNG), never the one played
   last for that profile; pitch (±`pitch_jitter`, the right foot +3 %, the left −3 %) and volume (±`volume_jitter_db`)
   are jittered, both widened per category by `category_jitter_scale` (steps ×1.7). A category may have more
   takes than the default (`category_variants`: steps have 6). Loudness adds `level_db`, `category_db`, `master_db`, plus the event (a step by speed/150, a
   bullet by `speed_factor`, a punch by damage).
5. A voice is acquired: if the category is at `category_voices`, its **oldest** voice is cut off; else a free one;
   else a new `AudioStreamPlayer2D` child is made (the pool grows lazily, never past the caps' sum).
6. A voice is free when its clip has played, counted in **simulated time** (`_now += delta`), not read from the
   player — a fixed-FPS test run outpaces the audio thread.

## Why a step is not mechanical (and why it is not tinny)

A footstep is a heel strike then a softer toe tap 45–62 ms later in the same tone, with a faint cloth rustle under it
(`SoundBank._footstep`, `vary` 0.22), drawn from 6 takes that differ in level, timing and tone, with wider pitch and
volume swing than other sounds and the feet 6 % apart in pitch. The cadence itself is the walk cycle's (stride-locked),
so it is regular only as far as the walking is. Test: `tests/audio/footstep_variety_test.gd`.

**Every surface is a dull thud on purpose.** High-passed noise bursts and 1.5–2.7 kHz ring tones read as tinny, so the
heel thump leads on every surface, the scuff is a soft noise low-passed at ≤ ~2.3 kHz, and no floor keeps a ring
(they pinged): wood, tile and stone (the slate tile floor) have none and sit 3 dB quieter. Surfaces therefore sound alike (wood/tile/stone/concrete/outdoors all sit at
~150–300 Hz RMS frequency, carpet softer and quieter via its `db`; wood and tile are the deepest of the hard floors,
~150–200 Hz, with a lower, longer heel thump). Keep scuff cut-offs low and give a new surface a `thump` first. Test:
`tests/audio/footstep_tone_test.gd` (brightness ceiling 0.03 against a measured 0.010, and most energy under 300 Hz).

## Why an impact has weight

Every impact carries a low **body** thump (150→55 Hz; the material's `thump` only scales it, `0.65 + 0.35·thump`),
however hard the thing struck, so metal, glass and ceramic thud as well as ring; their rings are quieter than the body
unless the round glances off (ricochet). The round's weight band sets how much (`BANDS`: `body` 0.8 / 1.0 / 1.7,
`pitch` 1.15 / 1.0 / 0.78 — rings take half the pitch shift —, `db` −4 / 0 / +4) and adds a deep **sub** boom to the
heavier rounds (`sub` 0 / 0.35 / 0.8). Within a band the hit is louder the faster the round (`speed_factor`, clamped
0.25–1.3) or the harder the punch (damage/10, clamped 0.3–1.5). Test: `tests/audio/impact_weight_test.gd` (every
medium impact keeps ≥ 40 % of its energy under 250 Hz; low-end weight, including level, rises ≥ 1.3× light→medium and
≥ 1.8× medium→heavy). To measure, `tools/dump_sounds.gd` then analyse the `.wav`s (the test's helpers are in
`tests/_audio/sound_probe.gd`: `brightness`, `low_share`, `low_weight`).

## Why a door is a thunk, not a creak

A vehicle door sits in a reload's register: its clicks are short noise bursts (a few ms, so they carry little
energy however crisp), and the body of the sound is low tones and low resonances: the latch's knock (140 → 80 Hz), the seal's thump
(100 → 58 Hz), the slam (125 → 48 Hz) with the panels at 150 / 230 Hz (the slide door 130 / 210 Hz) and the impact noise low-passed
at ~1 kHz. No creak and no panel ring: creaks and panel rings above ~300 Hz read high-pitched. Measured (`tests/_audio/sound_probe.gd`
`low_share` under 300 Hz, the lowest of the takes): car open 0.80, car close 0.82, van open 0.87, van close 0.86, slide open 0.82,
slide close 0.86 (the test's floor 0.75; footsteps and impacts ~0.83); brightness 0.001 to 0.018, far under the reloads' clicks (up
to 0.86). Keep a new door sound's high clicks short and its weight under ~150 Hz: the 2-pole measure counts a 165 Hz tone only
~0.6 low. Test: `tests/audio/vehicle_door_tone_test.gd`.

## Deafness: `Sound.focus`, `muffled()` and the tinnitus (G14)

`Sound.focus` is a character node (Main sets the human when there is one and clears it at teardown; null = nobody's ears, so an
AI's stun is silent). Audio reads only its `stun_view()` (`deaf`), duck-typed, so it stays a leaf.

- **`muffled()`** is true while the focus's `stun_view().deaf` is above 0 (false for a null, freed or non-stunnable focus), so it
  lifts exactly when the character's deafness ends, a longer second stun included.
- **The muffle:** every game voice plays on the `GameSound` bus (made in `Sound._ready`, sent to Master, an
  `AudioEffectLowPassFilter` on it); while muffled the filter closes toward `muffle_cutoff_hz` at `muffle_attack` a second (so the bang
  that deafens is still heard, then goes dull) and lifts at `muffle_release` (the hearing comes back slowly). Headless, the Dummy
  driver accepts the bus and its effect and nothing is heard, so a test asserts `muffled()`.
- **The tinnitus:** a `&"stun"` event for the focus with `deaf` > 0 starts one `tinnitus/whine` voice on the Master bus (so the muffle
  does not dull it), once per stun (the category's one voice is replaced by a second stun). The voice loops and **follows the
  deafness**: each frame its `until` and volume come from `stun_view().deaf`, fading over `tinnitus_tail` (1.5 s) and cut when the
  deafness ends; a stun shorter than `tinnitus_full_s` starts it quieter. Its range is `1e6` (it is in the listener's own head).

## Vehicle loops (`engine`, `skid`)

One looping voice per vehicle and kind, keyed by the vehicle's instance id (`_loops`); a second `start` for the same one is ignored.
`_start_loop` plays variant 0 at the vehicle with `until` = INF (it plays until stopped) and is **not** range-culled (it lasts, and the
listener may come closer); its `max_distance` is the category's range at the camera's zoom (`_range`), kept current. Each frame
`_follow_loops` moves the voice to the vehicle and glides its pitch and level (`loop_ease`) toward `_loop_aim`, read off the vehicle
duck-typed (Audio imports nothing from Vehicles):
- **engine:** pitch `lerp(engine_pitch.x, .y, rpm)`; level = the sound's level − `engine_load_db × (1 − load)` + `engine_rev_db × rpm`
  (`engine_state()`). An engine that no longer runs ends the loop.
- **skid:** pitch `1 + skid_pitch × slip`; level + `linear_to_db(clamp(slip / skid_full_slip, 0.1, 1) × clamp(speed / skid_full_speed, 0.25, 1))`.
A loop ends on its `stop` event, its vehicle freed, its engine stopped, or its voice taken by a newer one of the category (the voice's
`loop` key is cleared when it is reacquired). `loop_of(vehicle, kind)` is what tests read.

## Gotchas

- `play()` outside the scene tree logs an engine error (which fails a test); voices are only ever added as
  children of the autoload, which is in the tree.
- On quit `Sound._exit_tree` frees the voices and pauses 80 ms so the mixer thread can drop their playbacks;
  without it any process that quits mid-sound reports leaked `AudioStreamPlaybackWAV` objects.
- With a camera present (the test runner has one), range culling is live: audio tests that are not about distance
  set `SoundConfig.category_range` to `Probe.EVERYWHERE` (`tests/_audio/sound_probe.gd`).
- Sounds render lazily (1–12 ms each for most; one variant of each of the 205 profiles took ~2.2 s in a headless run at load average
  ~3.8, against `perf/audio_bank_render`'s 3000 ms budget; `audio/bank` checks the clips, not the time) and, with a display, are pre-rendered after launch, every variant of every profile
  (`Sound.library()`: the first variants first; 492 sounds), because a variant first synthesized in a fight is a 9–35 ms hitch.
  **The pre-warm renders on a worker thread** (`Sound.warm(pairs)`: one `WorkerThreadPool` task calling `SoundBank.render` for each
  pair not cached yet, ~4.8 s in all): a sound takes 1.5–33 ms to synthesize, more than a frame, so on the main thread every frame of
  the first ~8 s paid one (#78: 9.9 ms a frame of `perf/automatic_fire_stress` windowed). The worker hands each finished sound over
  under a mutex and the main thread files it into the cache at the next `_process` (`SoundBank.file`, which keeps a variant that
  played and was rendered on demand meanwhile); `warming()`, `finish_warming()` (wait and file the rest), and `_exit_tree` stops the
  worker after its current sound and waits for it, as every worker task must be. The cache is written on the main thread only.
  Headless tests render on first use (`Perf.warm_sounds()` in `tests/_perf/perf_probe.gd` does what the pre-warm would have by the
  time a match is fought). Test: `tests/audio/prewarm_off_main_thread_test.gd` (every variant cached, no main-thread synth, a pre-warmed
  sound the bytes of an on-demand render).
- Headless uses the Dummy audio driver: playback is accepted and silent. Nothing here can be heard by a test.

## Adding to it

- **A gun:** add its row to `GunConfig`; give it a recipe by adding a row to `SoundBank.SHOTS` (until then it
  borrows its band's). The `shot` event already carries `gun` and `power`.
- **A material:** a row in `SoundBank.MATERIALS` (`hard`, `db`, `thump`, `modes`/`amps`/`decays`, `lp`, `grit`).
- **A floor surface:** a row in `FOOTSTEPS`, and a case in `SoundSurface.surface_for`.
- **A vehicle kind:** a row in `SoundBank.VEHICLES` (until then it is voiced as a car).
- **A new category** (reload, a body falling …): a topic posted by the owning domain, a `*_profile` + recipe in
  `SoundBank`, a case in `Sound._on_posted`, entries in `SoundConfig`'s category tables, and a test.
- Audition without playing the game: `godot --headless --path . -s tools/dump_sounds.gd -- --out=DIR
  [--variants=2] [--filter=impact/metal]` writes every profile as a `.wav` and prints length, peak and render time.

## Verifying

`tools/run_tests.sh audio` (`tests/audio/`): `synth` (determinism, level, pitch, delays), `bank` (every profile
renders, cache, distinctness, library time budget), `profile_choice`, `surface`, `event_mapping` (synthetic bus
events → profiles), `sound_service` (caps, freeing, variety, reset, RNG isolation, range), `sound_switch_off`, and
the real-emitter tests `gun_shot_sound`, `impact_material_sound`, `impact_outcome_sound`, `impact_blocked_sound`,
`footstep_surface_sound`, `footstep_variety`, `footstep_tone`, `impact_weight`, `reload_sound`, `grenade_sounds` (throw, floor-voiced bounce,
`explosion/frag` against `explosion/stun`, the tinnitus and the muffle for the focus only; its range table adds the new categories, `Probe.everywhere`
in `tests/_ai/grenade_probe.gd`) and `vehicle_sounds` (ignition, the engine loop rising in pitch with speed and cut on exit, door open and
close, the van's slide door, the skid loop, a slow and a fast crash, a character struck, the van's engine deeper; through
`tests/_vehicle/vehicle_probe.gd`) and `vehicle_door_tone` (every door take no brighter than the brightest reload, over 0.75 of its
energy under 300 Hz). Switch `audio.sound` (`SoundConfig.enabled`) turns it all off.

**Interfaces:** 10 (EventBus: the topics above, and `&"sound"`), 13 (`audio.sound`, a sandbox's own voice), 16 (`SoundSurface`), 18 (`Sound.focus`), 19 (the vehicle a loop follows) — signatures in `architecture`.
