description: Deep implementation detail for the General domain (scenes/general/) — input (Keybinds), saved settings (Settings), the pausable game clock (GameClock), despawner, camera, the dev command server, shared physics-layer ids (PhysicsLayers), the draw-order ladder (DrawLayers), the light masks (LightMasks: occluder bits, shadow masks, light layers, the occluder shape), FillBatch (plain-coloured shapes drawn as one triangle array), WeightedPick (the shared weighted roll) and MatchVerdict (who has won a match). Use when editing scenes/general/ or working on input/keybinds/rebinding, the game clock AI timers run on, the saved settings file (debug switch + key bindings), the dev command server (gcmd), camera follow, the despawn cap, a cross-domain physics-layer constant, a draw-order rung, a light mask, batching many plain-coloured shapes, a weighted roll or the match verdict. HUDs and menus live in the UI domain (scenes/ui/) — see `domain-ui`. Complements the `architecture` skill, which holds the cross-domain interfaces.

# General domain

Infrastructure: input (Keybinds), saved settings (Settings), despawner, event bus, camera, dev command
server, shared physics-layer ids, the pausable game clock. `Keybinds`, `Despawner`, `EventBus` and `GameClock` are the General autoloads (`project.godot`; the Audio domain adds a fifth, `Sound`).
HUDs and menus are the **UI domain** (`scenes/ui/`) — see the `domain-ui` skill.

`physics_layers.gd` (`class_name PhysicsLayers`, no instance/autoload — same style as the other
`class_name` static holders) names physics-layer bits so they aren't redefined as magic numbers
per caller. `SOLID := 1` is the layer walls, solid furniture and bodies sit on — read by Interaction's reach query
(`character_interaction.gd`), AI perception's sight/line-of-fire rays (`agent_vision.gd`), the character's hand queries and leg sweeps (`character/body/`), a dropped
item's glance (`items/dropped_item.gd`), a thrown grenade's flight (`items/thrown_grenade.gd`), the bullet (`projectile/projectile.gd`), an
explosion's line (`projectile/explosion.gd`), `PhysicsConfig.wall_mask` and a vehicle's body, door and clearing queries (`scenes/vehicle/`).

`light_masks.gd` (`class_name LightMasks`, the same kind of holder, interface 11) is the light masks every domain builds its
shadows and light layers on (`docs/lighting.md` L6): the occluder bits `WALL` 1, `FURNITURE` 2, `EMITTER` 4 (a solid piece that
gives light), `CHARACTER` 8, `TALL` 16 (a piece with no light as tall as `TALL_COVERAGE` 75 `coverage`); the shadow masks the
Lighting domain gives its lights by their height (a 2D shadow has no length, so who shadows whom is picked by height):
`OVERHEAD_SHADOWS` (walls: an overhead light), `LOW_SHADOWS` (walls + tall pieces: a low light), `ALL_SHADOWS` (a flash); the item
light layers `HOUSE` 1 and `STREET` 2; `shadows` (whether occluders are built; the Testing domain's `lighting.enabled` turns it
off with `LightingConfig.enabled`) and `occluder(polygon, bit)`, the one place an occluder is shaped: wound clockwise on screen
and culled counter-clockwise, so the shape itself stays lit and only what lies behind it falls dark (null while `shadows` is off).
Objects' walls and solid pieces and the Character's body build theirs through it; Objects' street floors put themselves on
`STREET`.

`game_clock.gd` (autoload `GameClock`, interface 11) is the pausable game clock. A node, `PROCESS_MODE_PAUSABLE`, that counts
physics frames in `_physics_process`, so it stands still while the tree is paused (the spectator inspector's pause, the test runner's). `msec()` is frames × 1000 / `Engine.physics_ticks_per_second` (an int, the drop-in for
`Time.get_ticks_msec()`), `seconds()` the same in seconds, `frame()` the frame count. Under `--fixed-fps` a headless run reads the same
times every run, however far it outpaces the wall clock. It is an autoload node, not a `class_name` holder (an autoload and a class cannot
share a name), so callers read it off the singleton. Every AI ttl, timer and age runs on it (`docs/leadership.md` LD1, the AI's skills);
what measures real time (the Von launcher's boot timeout, Von's reply latency) stays on `Time`. Autoloads come before the main scene in
the tree, so it has counted the current frame before any NPC reads it.

`draw_layers.gd` (`class_name DrawLayers`, the same kind of holder) is the world's draw-order ladder (interface 11): `FLOOR` −5,
`RUG` −4, `BLOOD` −3 (blood and scorch decals), `LYING` −2 (a dead body, casings, a dropped item, a grenade at rest),
`UNDER_VEHICLE` −1 (a vehicle's chassis), `STANDING` 0 (the default: the living, furniture, walls), `ABOVE` 1 (a vehicle's roof, a
grenade in flight, the UI's stack markers), `OVERHEAD` 2 (a piece's overhang: a streetlight's arm and head over the road; a room's ceiling fixture), `EFFECTS` 4
(an explosion's flash and smoke). Every domain's z knob starts from its rung (`ObjectArtConfig`,
`BloodConfig`, `CharacterConfig`, the casing, the dropped item and grenade, the vehicle's layers, `ExplosionFx`, the UI's `StackMarkers`, `OrderMarkers` and `LeaderOverlay`), so a new layer is a
rung here, not a number in a domain.

`fill_batch.gd` (`class_name FillBatch`, a `RefCounted`, shared drawing infrastructure like `DrawLayers`) draws plain-coloured
shapes on a canvas item as ONE triangle array (`FillBatch.new(canvas, base)`, `base` the draw transform the caller set on it; then
`fill(poly, color, xform)`, `fill_convex(poly, color, xform)` for a polygon the caller knows is convex (fanned from its first
corner, uncut), `circle(center, radius, color, xform)`, then `flush()`) instead of one `draw_colored_polygon` / `draw_circle` command
each: rendering windowed, the engine builds a vertex
buffer per polygon command (~9 µs each, against a fifth of one for a rect). It cuts each polygon into the triangles the engine itself
would (`Geometry2D.triangulate_polygon`) and each disc into `draw_circle`'s 64-gon (point `i` at angle `i * TAU / 64`, measured: the
same pixels at 60x), in the order added, so it draws the same pixels; a polygon that cannot be triangulated goes to the engine on
its own after what was added, which reports it as `draw_colored_polygon` does. Under the headless display (`FillBatch.batching` false, from
`DisplayServer.get_name()`) nothing is rendered and gathering the array costs more than the commands it replaces, so a batch hands
each shape to its canvas as it comes (a placed disc by the canvas's transform and `draw_circle`); the chip chunk and the blood splat
draw their plain commands there themselves. Used by the body's limbs and shadow (Character), blood splats, the chip
and print chunks and the wound marks (Physics). Test: `tests/general/fill_batch_matches_draw_calls_test.gd` (headless, batching forced
on: the batch holds each polygon's own triangles, and off it holds nothing; `--windowed`: identical pixels to the plain calls).

`weighted_pick.gd` (`class_name WeightedPick`, a static holder like `PhysicsLayers`, interface 11) is the one weighted roll the
domains share. A roll takes one `rng.randf()` over the total of the weights, each entry in order taking the next stretch of it:
`WeightedPick.pick(rng, rows, key_index := 0, weight_index := 1, strict := false)` returns the drawn row's `key_index` value (`rows`
each an Array), `key(rng, weights, strict := false)` a key of a `key -> weight` Dictionary (in its order) and
`index(rng, rows, weight_index := 1, strict := false) -> int` the drawn row's index. `strict` keeps each caller's own edges: false, a
roll on the end of a stretch takes that entry and one past them all takes the last; true, it takes the next entry and one past them
all takes the first. World-Gen's room dresser, Objects' room wear and street marks, the Lighting domain's rhythms (not strict) and
the Character's style (strict) all draw through it, so the roll lives in one place. Tests: its users' simulation tests, and
beneath them the native unit suite `tests/general/weighted_pick_suite.gd` (`UnitSuite`, `domain-testing`): the edges, the
order, one roll per draw and the share by weight.

`match_verdict.gd` (`class_name MatchVerdict`, a static holder, interface 11) is who has won a match, the one rule the UI's
MatchHUD (its banner) and the dev command server's `match` verb both decide by. `MatchVerdict.decide(combatants) -> Dictionary` is
`{}` while every side (faction) still has someone alive; once a side is wiped out, `{ winner, survivors, sides }`: `winner` the faction
left standing, or null for a draw (nobody, or more than one side, left), `survivors` the living combatants and `sides` faction -> how
many combatants it fields. It reads them through the Character API only (`faction`, `is_dead`) and leaves a freed one out (its side not counted for it). Each
caller words the result: the HUD names a lone survivor in a match of any size, `verdict_of` only in a 1v1. Tests: the callers',
`tests/ui/match_hud_verdict_test.gd` and `tests/general/command_server_verdict_suite.gd`.

## Input architecture

All input flows through the `Keybinds` autoload; gameplay never hard-codes action strings or
`KEY_*`. To add/change an input: add an action constant, add its default to `DEFAULTS`, and expose
a typed helper. `player_controller.gd` (Character domain) is the one gameplay consumer of
Keybinds (movement, `RUN` — held, default Shift —, `CROUCH` (C) — a toggle, in the "Movement" group after Run — and the action keys, incl. `RELOAD`, default R, and `KICK`, default V, in the "Combat" group next to Punch and Fire, and `USE_VEHICLE`, default E, label
"Get in / out of vehicle", in the "Interaction" group after Interact: `is_use_vehicle_just_pressed()` → `character.try_use_vehicle()`;
while the player drives, its movement keys and `RUN` are the vehicle's throttle, steer and handbrake, read by the Vehicles domain off the
character's `move_input` / `run_input`, so driving adds no action). Everything else reads its own actions: `main.gd` and the test runner `MENU`, the spectator
inspector `PAUSE`, the UI's command menu `COMMAND` ("Command teammates", default right mouse, in the "Interaction" group after Get in / out of
vehicle; read only by the menu, which Main builds only when the human leads, and which reads `MENU` too, only to close itself), the camera its pan and zoom actions; `settings.gd` persists the bindings, and
`command_server.gd` (dev-only) reads the action *names* to inject real input when driving the game from
outside. `Keybinds._ready` registers every action in the InputMap, so there is no `project.godot [input]` section: this file
is the source of truth. `PAUSE`
(default Space) is read by the spectator inspector (UI domain) and the test runner; it shares Space with `INTERACT`,
harmless because the spectator match has no player to interact.

Each action holds exactly one binding, a key (stored by physical keycode) or a mouse button. Keyboard
defaults live in `DEFAULTS`, pointer defaults in `MOUSE_DEFAULTS` (`FIRE` left-click, `COMMAND` right-click, `ZOOM_IN` /
`ZOOM_OUT` wheel up/down); `actions()` is their union and what resets, overrides and loading cover.
`FIRE` is read two ways, both by the player controller: `is_fire_just_pressed()` (a click: one round) and `is_fire_pressed()`
(held: an automatic gun keeps firing, `Character.is_automatic()`); no new action, so rebinding `FIRE` moves both.
`CAMERA_LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN` (default WASD, read through `get_camera_vector()`) and `ZOOM_IN/OUT` are read
by the camera and the test runner; the camera keys share WASD with `MOVE_*`, harmless because the spectator match has no
player to move. `LABELS` (settings-page order + names) and `GROUPS` must cover every action (a test
enforces it). Runtime API: `bind(action, event)` (key or mouse button incl. wheel up/down; refuses the
horizontal wheel and anything else), `reset(action)` / `reset_all()`, `default_event`, `event_of`, `text_of` ("W", "Space",
"Mouse Left"; skips the layout lookup on the headless display server, which logs an error for it),
`conflicts_of(action)` (other actions on the same input, minus the deliberately shared `SHARED` pairs —
Interact/Pause and each camera pan key with its move key), and `overrides()` / `apply_overrides(d)` (only the bindings that differ from the
defaults, as `{ "key": int }` / `{ "mouse": int }`; malformed entries are skipped one by one).
`Keybinds._ready` registers the defaults only.

## Saved settings

`settings.gd` (`class_name Settings`, a static holder like the config holders — no instance, no autoload)
keeps the **Debug** switch (`Settings.debug`, the master switch for the AI overlays), the setup window's last choices, the overlay
toggles and the key-binding overrides in one JSON file, `Settings.path` (`user://settings.json`):
`{ "debug": bool, "setup": { side, seed, lead, defenders, invaders }, "overlays": { show_<x>: bool }, "keybinds": { action: { "key": int } | { "mouse": int } } }`. Only differences from
the defaults are stored, so a changed default still reaches an action the player never touched.
- **`load_file()`** resets every binding, applies the saved overrides and takes the saved `debug`, `setup` and `overlays`; a
  missing file keeps the defaults, an unreadable one `push_warning`s and does the same, and a file that
  doesn't name `debug` leaves it as it was.
- **Main calls it, not `Keybinds._ready`**, once in `_ready` (after seeding `Settings.debug` from its own
  export), so the headless test runner — which never loads `main.tscn` — never reads a developer's file.
- **`Settings.setup`** holds the match-setup window's last choices (`set_setup(config)` saves them, dropping the
  start `mode`; `lead`, "Lead the team", is kept; each side's dict is kept whole: count, loadout and `outfit`); Main feeds it back into the window so it reopens as it was left.
- **`Settings.overlays`** holds the toggle bar's switches (`set_overlay(flag, on)` saves one); Main seeds the overlays from it.
- **Mutators save at once:** `set_debug(on)`, `set_setup(config)`, `set_overlay(flag, on)`, `rebind(action, event) -> bool`, `reset(action)`,
  `reset_all()` (leaves `debug`). `binding_rows()` reshapes the bindings into the plain dicts the settings
  page draws: `{ action, label, group, text, conflicts: [labels], changed }`.
- Tests point `Settings.path` at a scratch file with `set_static` (`tests/general/settings_file_test.gd`);
  `Keybinds` state is not restored by the harness, so a test that rebinds ends with `Keybinds.reset_all()`.

## Dev command server

`command_server.gd` (a node in `main.tscn`, editor-only, cleaned up on exit) lets an external tool
control a running game with text commands. It is **off** unless the port — the `GODOT_CMD_PORT` env
var (per-worktree, set by `tools/editor.sh`), else `application/debug/command_port` — is >
0 and never exists in an exported build (`_ready()` bails when `OS.has_feature("editor")` is
false). `GODOT_CMD_PORT=off` keeps it off whatever port is set (no listen, no warning): `tools/load_check.sh`,
`tools/run_tests.sh` and the coverage runner (`tools/coverage/runner.py` `game_env`) always run Godot with it, over a
port the caller set, so two worktrees' checks never clash on 9080 (`tools/tests/test_load_check.py` holds 9080 and
passes the check). It listens on 127.0.0.1 with a line-delimited protocol: each line is a curated verb
(`help`, `pos`, `tp X Y`, `slot N`, `move up|down|left|right [off]`, `stop`, `fire`, `punch`, `kick`,
`interact`, `reload`, `crouch`, `aim X Y`, `match`, `ai`, `restart [seed]`, `menu`, `eval EXPR`) or, failing that, a GDScript `Expression`
evaluated against the node (e.g. `scene().get_node("Player").speed`). Movement and actions are
driven by injecting `Input` action presses through `Keybinds` names — the same path a human's
keyboard/mouse uses — so no game domain is coupled to it. Combatants and the player are discovered under the scene root **or a node in the `match_world` group** (Main's container for everything a match builds). `match` prints a one-line, parseable
status of every AI combatant it finds: each one's health, current act and
alive flag, plus the verdict and elapsed time — reading only the characters' public API (`health`, `is_dead`,
`faction`, `name`) and their
AI controller's `current_act()` (the child in the group `npc_controllers`, interface 7). The verdict (`verdict_of(combatants)`, static) words `MatchVerdict.decide`,
the rule the MatchHUD decides by too: `none` while every faction has someone alive; once one is wiped out, the one left standing by its
faction (a 1v1 names the survivor, where the HUD names a lone survivor in any match); `draw` with nobody, or more than one faction,
left (`tests/general/command_server_verdict_suite.gd`). `ai` is the diagnostic counterpart: it dumps every AI combatant's
`debug_state()` as JSON (every level of its last decision walk — the state and question Von saw,
the options, Von's probabilities and pick — plus the facts gated on, the known contacts, the running
primitive and the pathing state), read off the same controller so the server stays a decoupled
observer. `tools/von_probe.py --capture` turns such a dump into replayable Von scenarios. `restart [seed]` reloads the scene for a fresh matchup, pinning the
next layout when a seed is given (stashed in `Engine` meta, which survives the reload; `main.gd`
reads it) and sets the `skip_setup` Engine meta so the reloaded scene builds immediately instead of
reopening the pre-game setup window — the harness never clicks it. Drive it from `tools/gcmd.py` (`python3 tools/gcmd.py "tp 600 300"`) for single
commands, or `tools/match.py` to run and score N matches in a row; each command is echoed as a
`[cmd] …` Output line. (The `godot-run` skill covers driving it.)

## Event bus

`event_bus.gd` (autoload `EventBus`) — a minimal generic publish/subscribe bus for decoupled
cross-domain notifications: `post(topic, data)` broadcasts and the `posted(topic, data)` signal
delivers to any listener, which filters by `topic`. Emitters and listeners never reference each
other. Topics in use: `&"hit"`, posted by the Projectile System for each damaging hit and
by the Character for each landed punch (`{ position, victim, direction, damage, attacker }`, plus
`outcome` / `material` and, for bullets, `speed_factor`, `power`)
and consumed by the AI for combat awareness, hostility and gunfire heard, by Audio for impacts;
`&"shot"` (a round left a gun; also the Lighting domain's muzzle flash), `&"footfall"` (a foot landed) and `&"reload"` (a
reload started / finished), posted by
Items and Character and consumed by Audio; the grenades' `&"throw"` (consumed by Audio), `&"grenade"` (a bounce or rest, consumed by Audio and the AI), `&"explosion"` (consumed by Audio, the camera shake, the
Lighting domain's flash and the AI) and `&"stun"` (Audio's tinnitus and the stun screen); the vehicles' `&"vehicle"` (ignition, doors, crashes, a character struck), `&"engine"` and `&"skid"` (consumed by Audio);
`&"sound"`, which Audio posts for every sound it
makes (what tests assert on); `&"callout"`, an AI
controller's team radio (`{ speaker, faction, position, status, path, label, target_id, point }`),
consumed by allied AIs; and the squads' (`ai/team/squad.gd`) `&"order"`, a leader's order (`{ id, leader, faction, to, kind, … }`),
consumed by the AI controllers of its side it names in `to`, and `&"leader"`, a new leader after a death (`{ faction, leader, previous }`),
which no game code listens to: its readers are the test runner's event log and the tests that assert on it.

## Camera and despawner

- `camera_controller.gd` — by default follows the character; attaches by exported node path and
  reads only the public API/signals. It also has a **framing mode** (`frame(targets)`): instead of
  following one target it eases to the midpoint of the live targets and zooms to fit them plus
  `frame_margin` (clamped by `min_zoom`/`max_zoom`), dropping any whose `is_dead` is true — used by
  the spectator match view.
  - **Zoom** (both modes): the `ZOOM_IN`/`ZOOM_OUT` actions (mouse wheel) scale the zoom by `zoom_step`
    per notch. A trackpad's two-finger scroll arrives as `InputEventPanGesture` (no wheel events on macOS) and
    counts `trackpad_zoom_sensitivity` notches per unit of its `delta.y` (up zooms in); it isn't rebindable. The scale (`_zoom_bias`) is lasting and multiplies the
    automatic zoom (`_base_zoom`: 1 when following, the clamped fit when framing), so it works the same
    in both modes, can go beyond the fit's `min_zoom`/`max_zoom`, and is limited only by
    `wheel_min_zoom`/`wheel_max_zoom`. The zoom eases at `follow_speed`. Read in `_unhandled_input`, so
    scrolling UI gets the wheel first.
  - **Hand control** (framing mode only): the camera keys or the mouse within `edge_pan_margin` px of
    a screen edge pan the camera at `pan_speed` (screen px/s, so zoom-independent). Panning
    sets `_manual`, which suspends the automatic framing position (the zoom keeps auto-fitting, scaled
    by the wheel); after `manual_hold` (5) seconds without panning `_manual` clears and the framing
    eases back in. Edge
    panning only runs while the pointer has been seen moving over the window (`_mouse_in_window`,
    cleared on `NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_EXIT` / focus-out), so a cursor that left at an edge or has
    never moved can't drag the camera. `pan_enabled` off removes the pan (wheel still works); the
    test runner turns it off for a world with a human-driven player, where WASD walks.
- **Zoom out while driving** (both modes): `_drive_zoom_out(who)` reads `who.vehicle().view_zoom_out()` duck-typed (`has_method` on the
  target and on what `vehicle()` returns; 0 on foot, clamped to 0..0.9), never `VehicleDriveConfig`. Following, `_ease_zoom(1 − that)` scales the
  automatic zoom down, so the view widens with the vehicle's speed (`VehicleDriveConfig.zoom_out`, 0.35, at its top speed) and eases back
  in as it slows, at the follow easing; framing, the largest among the live framed targets is used. The wheel's `_zoom_bias` multiplies on
  top. Test: `tests/general/camera_zooms_out_driving_test.gd`.
- **Explosion shake** (`&"explosion"` on the EventBus, both modes): a burst adds trauma (0..1) = `shake_frag` (1.0) / `shake_stun` (0.5) times
  `near²`, `near` = 1 − distance / the kind's range (`shake_frag_range` 1500, `shake_stun_range` 900; beyond it nothing), capped at 1, and the view
  is thrown about through `Camera2D.offset` by `shake_max_offset` (28 px) × trauma² / zoom (two out-of-step wobbles per axis at `shake_speed`),
  the trauma draining at `shake_decay` (1.2 /s) so it settles back to a zero offset. The offset never touches `global_position`, so following and
  framing are unchanged. Test: `tests/general/camera_shakes_on_explosion_test.gd`.
- `game_log.gd` (`GameLog`, a `class_name` static holder) — the one way any domain logs what is happening:
  `GameLog.say(message)` prints while `GameLog.enabled` (default true). A `tools/run_tests.sh` run (gdUnit) turns it off
  unless `--verbose`; never route errors/warnings through it.
- `despawner.gd` (autoload) — global cap for transient bodies (flying debris chips, `HitParticles`, the `ExplosionFx` nodes, casings, blood
  splatters and pools, a grenade's `GrenadeSpoon`); domains register spawns with it. The Physics domain's `DebrisLayer` and `ScorchDecals` read
  `max_scene_objects` as the cap on landed chips and scorch marks too.

HUDs and menus (`debug_ui.gd`, `match_hud.gd`, `setup_menu.gd`) belong to
`scenes/ui/` — see the `domain-ui` skill for their implementation detail.

## Spectator match mode

`main.gd`'s `spectator_mode` (on by default) turns the scene into an AI-only contest between the NPC sides
(`defender_count` / `invader_count` NPCs, 1 each by default and up to the setup window's 8 a side): it frees the
human `Player` and `DebugUI`, points the camera at every combatant in framing mode (`frame(combatants)`), and activates
`MatchHUD`. The `match` / `restart` command verbs plus `tools/match.py` make the matchup scriptable
for watching and regression-testing both AI agent-types (defender and invader). Composition-root
wiring lives in `main.gd`; the General observers only read published contracts.

**Interfaces:** 7 (the `Keybinds` consumers and observers), 10 (EventBus), 11 (`PhysicsLayers`, `DrawLayers`, `LightMasks`, `GameClock`, `WeightedPick`, `MatchVerdict`), 14 (`Settings`, the dev command server), 15 (`GameLog`), 19 (the camera's `vehicle().view_zoom_out()`, `USE_VEHICLE`) — signatures in `architecture`.
