name: ticket-harness
description: Extra rules for a ticket labelled `harness` (skills, AGENTS.md, hooks, tools/, command server, test runner), with `ticket-story` - instruction changes get no tests, agent-facing tools do. Invoked from `ticket`.

# Ticket: harness

Covers `.claude/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, hooks, `tools/` scripts (`gcmd.py`, `run_tests.sh`, `play_tests.sh`,
`editor.sh`, `von_probe.py`, `match.py` …), the dev command server (`scenes/general/command_server.gd`) and the test
runner (`scenes/testing/`).
Follow every `ticket-story` phase; only what gets tested differs. Writing or editing a skill, `AGENTS.md` or a doc an
agent reads: load `mattpocock-skills:writing-for-agents` (a description is an always-loaded pointer: short, one
trigger per case).

## What is tested

- **Skills and instructions: no tests.** A skill, `AGENTS.md`, a doc, a hook's wording, a checklist, or a tool change
  that only rewords help text or a log line: build it in `ticket-story` phase 3 without the red step. Check instead,
  in phase 4 and the audit: every skill, file, command, flag and name mentioned exists as spelled now; frontmatter valid (`name` = folder,
  `description` says when to use it); no reference left to a renamed or removed skill (`grep -rn` the old name); the
  routing skills (`ticket`, `architecture`, `AGENTS.md`) list it.
- **Tools an agent uses on the app: tests first** (red first, per `ticket-story` phase 3): a command-server verb, a
  `tools/` script that drives, queries or inspects the game, a runner flag or report field, a probe or overlay an agent reads.
  Test it the way an agent uses it: a game test for an in-game surface (`domain-testing`; harness ones in
  `tests/_harness/`, run by `--self-test` through `tests/_harness/harness_suite.gd`), or for a script a run against the
  headless game or a fixture, checking output and exit code. A behaviour is proved by a simulation test (`GameTest`);
  a native gdUnit suite (`*_suite.gd`, `UnitSuite`) is for pure logic only and may add fast checks beneath it, never
  replace it.
- **The runner itself** (`tools/run_tests.sh`, `scenes/testing/`): it drives gdUnit4's command-line tool, so its own
  tests are `tools/test_log_gate.py` (verdicts, lines, report, flags, the log gate; a fake Godot and the real engine) and
  `tools/test_gdunit_wrap.py` (every catalog test one wrapper case, by id) and `tools/test_gdunit_panel.py` (a run as the
  editor's GdUnit panel starts it: its verdicts and a clean checkout), with `--self-test` (`domain-testing`), and
  `tools/tests/test_run_tests_flags.py` (each flag the batch reads is one the wrapper forwards).
- **A tool test writes only in a temp dir or a copy of the checkout** (`copy_checkout()` in `tools/test_log_gate.py`,
  or a throwaway git repo), never in the live tree, where another run in the worktree would see its probe;
  `tools/tests/test_tool_tests_stay_out.py` fails on a write to a path built from `ROOT`.
- Both in one ticket: test only the tool part. Game code added so a tool can read it is a tool change: test it and
  keep `architecture` true.

## Wrap-up for skill-only work

Phase 4 is: lint and load check if any `.gd` changed (`godot-run`), a read-through of each changed skill against the
code, and a check that no other skill or doc now disagrees. The audit still runs; its skills step is the main check.
