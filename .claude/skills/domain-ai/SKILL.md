Use when editing scenes/ai/ or working on NPC goals/behaviour, or to find which sub-domain owns a concern. Complements the `architecture` skill (cross-domain interfaces).

# AI domain (`scenes/ai/`) — overview

Non-player brains. **One** generic, data-driven controller drives every NPC (house defender and
invader alike) — there is no per-NPC-type or per-goal code. An NPC's behaviour is pure DATA authored
on its scene: a plain-language `goal` string (`{gun}` in it stands for the NPC's own gun; `goal_text()` is the filled-in text)
plus a handful of generic primitives (hostility rules, pursuit, territory) and decision-tree config. A controller writes the character's intent and calls
its public action API — it never reaches into character internals.

The domain is split into **four isolated sub-domains** around a thin orchestrator, each a module
folder under `scenes/ai/` that talks to the others only through a small published interface — the same
isolation the game applies between top-level domains. This skill is the map; load the per-sub-domain
skill for detail.

## The orchestrator + four sub-domains

`ai/goal_controller.gd` is the **orchestrator** — the AI's own composition root (the `main.gd` of the
AI domain). It is the single **authoring surface** (every tunable is an export here, so a defender or
invader preset is all data on this one node), it wires the sub-domains and pushes its exports into
them — building them once, then re-pushing the config each decision so a tunable retuned at runtime
(a behaviour test, the dev command server) takes effect without a rebuild, and on its first `control(character, delta)` hands the NPC's
body to perception and behaviour once (`bind(character)`, which each passes on to its modules), so no sub-domain function takes the
character — and it runs the
**SENSE → THINK → ACT** loop plus the decide cadence, salient-event detection (a change of belief about hostiles, the behaviour's `salient_key`; the order just
adopted is not one: `_on_decided` re-takes the key after `set_leaf`, since the order sets or clears the engaged contact the key carries, issue #51 R12, test
`ai/decision/adopt_target_no_redecide`), interrupting a decision
walk the situation has overtaken, and the EventBus intake (`&"hit"`, `&"footfall"`s within earshot, allies' `&"callout"`s, `&"grenade"` landings,
`&"explosion"`s and its leader's `&"order"`s (Orders, below), queued and handed to perception on the next tick) and its own callouts (a combat one carries `target_pos`, where its hostile is).

| Sub-domain | Folder | Skill | Owns (role) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Perception** | `ai/perception/` | `domain-ai-perception` (+ `domain-ai-snapshot` for the snapshot: `agent_snapshot.gd`, `perception/snapshot/`) | SENSE — what the NPC knows (sight, hostility, event memory, movement tracks, gunfire heard, allies' callouts) and the combat geometry (`agent_tactics.gd`: flanks, fire/advance/retreat spots); builds the decision SNAPSHOT — state sections, facts, option groups — worded for Von (`agent_snapshot.gd`). |
| **Decision** | `ai/decision/` | `domain-ai-decision` | THINK — the decision TREE (data), the planner that walks it with Von one `choice` request per level, and the Von transport + dev-only server launcher. |
| **Behaviour** | `ai/behavior/` | `domain-ai-behavior` (+ `domain-ai-combat` for `combat.gd`, `domain-ai-coverage` for `search_coverage.gd`, `domain-ai-watch` for `watch.gd`, `domain-ai-entry` for `entry.gd`) | ACT — runs the chosen leaf's primitive (move / engage / melee / interact / hold / reload / entry / throw / defend / ambush) and the commitment state Von lacks; owns a locomotion layer for pathing, and the tactical entry phase machine (`entry.gd`). |
| **Debug** | `ai/debug/` | `domain-ai-debug` | Draw-only overlays: the vision cone/bubble, the decision-path label + movement path, the tactical zones it weighed, search coverage, and behaviour overlays (contacts, hearing/radio, combat, territory, move/use targets, Von/brain, routes, stuck, the entry plan, the entry team and guard). |

**The human's stack (`ai/team/player_stack.gd`).** Not a fifth sub-domain: one small module, the human's side of the entry radio
(`docs/tactical-entry.md` E16). A child of the human's character (Main attaches it through `MatchSpawner.bind_player`), it listens to the
`&"callout"` bus like an NPC and, when an allied team is stacking at a doorway the human is near (`reserve_range` 300 px of walking), radios the
human's own claim for the first free slot (none in a dead end with no room left, E20), on the team's side or, when its way there would cross the doorway's view, on its own (a split stack,
E19), standing on the side `side_for` gives that slot (`_on`: the other side while its own wall is full, E21) at `stack_point`: the same entry
fields plus `human: true` (no AI moves up into its slot, E2) and `leader` (true while its `squad`'s `leader()` is the human; `squad` is handed in by
`MatchSpawner.bind_squad`, LD17: a stack the human ordered waits for it), with the human as `speaker`, repeated every 2 s. It reads the human's step
from where it stands (`claim` / `ready` / `going_in` / `in`) and withdraws on leaving, dying, nobody left stacking, or `go_timeout` after the AI
ahead in the crossing order is through, or (`abort`) when the stack grows past what a dead end holds for its slot. It reuses perception's `AgentEntry` (the statics `claims`, `free_slot`, `stack_side`, `crossing_order`,
`side_for`, `stack_point`, `holds_slot`, and `geometry` / `stack_side_from`) and `AgentGrenades.is_call` (a grenade call is not a stack claim; nor is a callout that is
only an order's progress, `order_step` with no `entry_step`, LD7), and never moves the
character. `view()` feeds `StackMarkers` (UI). `entry.gd` has no case for a human: the barrier, the lone entrant's pie and the follow rule just
see one more teammate, and a held stack (LD13) takes a teammate's `going_in`, the human's too, as its go (D14).

**The squad (`ai/team/squad.gd`, `docs/leadership.md` LD3 to LD7, interface 21).** One per side, a `Node` Main builds under `World` after
arming the characters (`setup(faction, roster, openings, rooms, human := null, claim_ttl := 0.0)`) and hands each NPC (`MatchSpawner.bind_squad`: the
controller's `squad`). Its leader is the highest `rank`, the first spawned among equals (the human when it leads); on the leader's `died`
the next leads within the frame and it posts `&"leader"` `{ faction, leader, previous }`. `issue(request)` turns a leader's plain request
(`{ kind, to, pos?, room?, bang?, mode?, wait_go? }`) into an `&"order"` (`defend_room` / `stack` / `ambush` / `cancel`: the room key, or
the doorway nearest `pos` within its width, a stack's room on the far side of the wall plane, `stack_at` or `split`, its `mode` quiet / stun /
frag (`bang` true for any but quiet; a request with no `mode` reads it from `bang`) and `wait_go` (LD13); an ambush's `room` on the click's
side of the wall plane and `beyond` the room on the other, "" for an exterior door, LD15, D17; a `defend_room`, `stack` or `ambush` order
also carries its target point `pos`, the room's centre or the doorway's, which the UI's order markers draw) and posts it; no `to` is every
living member but the leader. A `go` request (`{ kind: "go", pos }`, LD13) posts a `go` order (`opening`, `pos`) to every living member
holding a held stack (`wait_go`) at the doorway nearest `pos` that no go has released yet, whatever its `to` (D13), and replaces nothing; when
the leader that gave held stacks dies the squad posts their go itself (`auto: true`, D12). `resolve(request)` is that resolution read-only,
without posting (`{ room, pos }`, `{ opening, pos, into, split, stack_at? }`, `{ opening, pos }` for a go, `{ opening, pos, room, beyond }` for
an ambush: what the UI's command menu names its stack and ambush items from); `view()` is `{ leader, members: [{ node, order, step, held }], stacks }`, the
steps read off the members' progress callouts (`order_step`), a released held stack carrying `go: true`, `held` whether the order is a stack
still waiting for the leader's go (`_waits_for_go`, LD13: the one place that rule is worked out; the UI reads it); an order radioed `done` is no longer
held (`order` {}, `step` `done`), a `refused` one still is. `stacks` (LD18, `_stacks` / `_slots_of`) is every stack the side is forming, ordered
or its own, from the members' entry claims it hears (`_claims`, the latest per speaker, current for `_claim_ttl`: the NPCs' `callout_ttl` (6 s), handed in by `setup`, which Main reads off
the side's NPCs with `MatchSpawner.callout_ttl_of`; a dead speaker's dropped;
the human's `PlayerStack` among them), while a claim is at `claim` / `ready` / `bang` / `going_in` (`STACKING`): `[{ opening, into, door, slots:
[{ n, point, holder, held, there, mine, side, row }] }]`, slots 1 to the last claimed laid with its own `AgentEntry` (`stack_slots`, `side_for`,
`stack_point`; a slot a dead end does not hold left out), `there` its holder at `ready` / `bang` (`IN_SLOT`), `mine` the human's; the UI's stack
markers draw it, laid on the navigation map and physics space of the world the squad itself is in (its viewport's `World2D`). It reads its
members only through the Character API (`rank`, `is_dead`, `died`) and the bus, and reuses `AgentEntry.opening_id` / `normal_into` and the slot statics. An AI leader issues no orders.

**Orders (`docs/leadership.md`).** The controller queues `&"order"` events; one that names the NPC (and its side) becomes its live order
(`AgentPerception.process_order`) and forces a decision (`_force_now("ordered")`); from that frame until a decision made knowing the order
lands a walk the order replaces stops, while a fight goes on (`_order_from` = `_decisions`, `Behavior.await_order(true)`, `domain-ai-behavior`):
`_maybe_interrupt` restarts a decision walk in flight, and `_on_decided` drops a leaf from a walk begun before the order (LD6). The entry rule `ordered → order` sits after the fight rules
and before `hostile_known`, so an ordered member shot at fights, then goes back to its order. The ORDER node's one option (the snapshot's
`order` group) is auto-picked: `defend` for a room (the behaviour's `defend` primitive, at its D2 spot), an `entry` for a stack, an `ambush`
for an ambush (the behaviour's `ambush` primitive, at its post from `AgentEntry.ambush_spot`, LD15). A `go` is no new order: perception
latches it on the held stack it releases (`go: true`) and no decision is forced. Each
decision the controller pushes `confine_room` (a defend order's room) into the planner, which keeps the fight to options inside it, and
radios the order's progress (`order_id`, `order_step`: `moving` / `in_position` from the behaviour, `done` / `refused` from the perception).
An order the NPC cannot carry out (no option built) is ended `refused` as `_start_decision` begins the walk, and `confine_room` is cleared for that walk;
a stack at a dead end with no slot for the member is kept instead, its option a `hold` whose params carry `refused` (LD9, D21). An ordered stack (LD9) is an entry that goes in the order's way (its
side, its mode, a wait for every living recipient, and for the human leader holding a slot, up to `order_ready_cap`, LD17), from anywhere and for a defender too, its way read before
it claims and its walk guarded, its claims (`_post_entry_call`) carrying `order_id` / `order_bang` / `order_mode` / `order_hold` / `order_go` / `order_side`
beside every claim's `stuns`, `frags`, `claim_frame`, `claim_pos`, `move_up` and `pie`; it ends done at the room cleared
(`domain-ai-entry`). A held stack (LD13) waits at its slots, ready, until its go; a frag stack (LD14) has a frag carrier throw a frag in
first. An ambush (LD15) ends done on first contact, a hostile in sight or shots at the member (`AgentPerception._end_ambush_on_contact`, D18).

Data flow each tick: the orchestrator folds queued hits and callouts into **Perception**, has it
`observe()` and return `contacts()`; hands those to **Behaviour** to resolve + honour commitments;
when free (or forced), its routes can be measured as it will walk them (`AgentPerception.routes_ready`: the avoid map of the doorway views from the room it
stands in is baked, a few frames at most, `docs/tactical-entry.md` E18) and the frame has a snapshot to spare (`DecisionBudget`: `per_frame` snapshots a physics frame, one by
default, so NPCs deciding together spread over frames), asks **Perception** for a snapshot and starts a **Decision** walk
over it;
adopts the returned leaf into **Behaviour** (and radios it to allies); then has **Behaviour** `apply()`
the running primitive.

**Observer reads** (pure reads, never perturbing the loop). The controller joins the group `npc_controllers` in its `_ready` (interface 7):
that is how the HUDs tell an NPC's controller among a character's children (the UI's `hud_probe.gd`). `debug_status()` is the decision path as labels plus the running
primitive's progress. `debug_state() -> Dictionary` is the deep snapshot: every level of the last walk (the state and question
Von saw, the options, its probabilities and pick), the facts, the contacts, the running primitive and pathing (`loco`: the walk's
`way` plain / round / held / doors, `held_for`, `giving_way`), and `decisions` (walks started) with `decision_reason` (why the latest started:
the force reason, e.g. "task resolved", "way blocked", "attacked", or "cadence"); the dev command
server's `ai` verb dumps it and `tools/von_probe.py` replays captured levels against Von. `debug_zones() -> Array` flattens the
last snapshot's option groups to world points, each with its `label`, `desc` (for an inspector to explain a clicked point) and
`tags`, tagged by zone kind (fire / flank / advance / retreat / lead / search / entry / room / interaction / grenade (where a throw
weighed would burst, with `from`, the throw spot or the NPC's own spot), plus `waypoint` for the non-room go-to points: post / entrance / approach). `debug_state()["order"]` is the order leaf the NPC is carrying out (`{ path, primitive, params, paused }`, `paused` while an entry detour of the
entry guard holds it, its primitive and params then the order's, not the detour's; {} with none), beside the running `primitive` / `params`.
`debug_room_zones() -> Array` gives each room `{ rect, type, status }`
by how the NPC regards it (current / searched / unsearched / unknown). Both feed the tactics overlay (`domain-ai-debug`), which also rings
the point an observer asked to highlight: `debug_focus(point)` / `debug_clear_focus()` (the spectator inspector's clicked zone; debug only), read
back as `debug_focus_point()`.

## Grenades (`docs/grenades.md`)

Two decisions Von makes and two reflexes outside it. **GRENADE** (G17) is a COMBAT tactic: offered against a hostile hidden from the NPC's line of fire or in a room the NPC is outside of (barricaded), or, shot at by someone unseen from a room it is outside of, where the shots came from, in throw range with a clear lob from where it stands or from a
throw spot a short walk away (`agent_tactics.gd` `throw_spot`, issue #51 R13 / R15), when no known ally would be in the blast and the NPC could get safe
from it itself (judged from where it throws); it runs the `throw` primitive (walk to the throw spot, select, aim, throw, radio `frag_out` / `bang_out`, gun back in hand, wait out the fuse, or the evade plan if it is in the
burst's zone). **STUN ENTRY** (G18) is a SEARCH tactic beside ENTER, offered while the NPC or its stack carries a stun: the same doorways, with a stun thrown into the room from beside the door before the point crosses (the `bang` phase of
`entry.gd`, `docs/tactical-entry.md` E17); Von takes it for a suspect room (gunfire or footsteps heard there, shots from it, an ally's fight in it, a hostile lost in it, by its doorway or heading in). `perception/snapshot` words both (`domain-ai-snapshot`), the tree has the nodes (`domain-ai-decision`), `combat.gd` throws (`domain-ai-combat`), `entry.gd` runs the bang (`domain-ai-entry`); the numbers it
knows of a grenade not yet thrown (throw range, radii, fuses, the flash's cover reach) it reads off the grenades it carries (`Character.throw_stats(slot)`, interface 6/7; no copy in exports).

Two reflexes outside Von, in the orchestrator's loop (`_react_to_grenades`, `_process_events`), and the exports **Grenades** group (`grenades_enabled`, `hear_grenade` 300 px, `evade_margin` 120 px, `blind_fire_chance` 0.5):
- **Evade (G16).** Perception knows the live grenades it sees, hears come down, is told of (callout `status` `grenade`, also `frag_out` / `bang_out`) or threw; when it is inside a
  grenade's danger zone it radios an `&"grenade"` callout (`point` = where it landed, `kind`) and the behaviour runs to the nearest safe spot (out of the burst's line, behind furniture that
  shields a crouched body, or outside the zone), holds it facing away and re-decides at the burst. No decision starts or is adopted meanwhile. `perception/agent_grenades.gd`,
  `agent_throw.gd`, `behavior.gd` ("The evade reflex"). `debug_grenades()` reads it; the `show_grenades` overlay draws it.
- **Stunned (G15).** Blind: no new sighting, no new decision (it re-decides the tick sight returns), its contacts kept so it fires blind at the last-known spot of the one it fought (the character's aim
  sway applies, one-handed) when its one roll as it goes blind hits `blind_fire_chance` (Grenades export, 0.5; drawn from the controller's own RNG, seeded at bind from the
  character's name and spawn spot, so a seeded run rolls the same; a re-stun while blind does not reroll), else it holds its fire until it can see (`Combat.holds_fire`); deaf: the orchestrator drops gunfire, hits elsewhere, footfalls, callouts and grenade landings it would have heard.

## Hearing (`docs/hearing.md`)

The NPC hears the footsteps of characters not of its faction through walls (H1), out to a range by gait: the exports **Hearing** group, `hear_walk` 250 px,
`hear_run` 450 px, `hear_crouch` 100 px. A heard step is an INVESTIGATE lead and a reason to suspect the room it came from; `debug_memory()["footsteps"]` reads it.

## The decision tree

```
root ─┬─ ORDER   → the order the NPC's leader gave it, auto-picked           (defend / entry / ambush)
      ├─ COMBAT (pick the hostile) ─┬─ ENGAGE  → a safe firing spot / ambush   (engage)
      │                             ├─ RELOAD  → swap in a magazine             (reload)
      │                             ├─ FLANK   → a side, route clear of hostiles (engage)
      │                             ├─ GRENADE → frag or stun a hostile hidden or barricaded in a room, or the shots' room (throw)
      │                             ├─ ADVANCE → halfway / close / rush         (move)
      │                             ├─ MELEE   → punch, only when point-blank   (melee)
      │                             ├─ RETREAT → a hidden / farther spot        (move)
      │                             └─ LOCATE  → toward an unseen shooter       (move)
      ├─ INVESTIGATE ─┬─ a lead (last seen, heading, gunfire, footsteps, ally's call) (move)  [always asked of Von]
      │               └─ STAY → hold, when a lead is outside the house          (hold)
      ├─ SEARCH ─┬─ ENTER → a doorway into a room left to search              (entry)
      │          ├─ STUN ENTRY → the same with a stun thrown in first (a stun in the stack) (entry{bang})
      │          └─ a room / unexplored area / the entrance                     (move)
      ├─ RELOAD_QUIET → top up with nobody about                                (reload)
      └─ IDLE ─┬─ USE → an object · GO → a room · WAIT                           (interact / move / hold)
```

Entry rules skip the broad levels when the situation is clear (under fire / engaged → straight to COMBAT; ordered → ORDER; — when
pursuing — a hostile known → COMBAT). A level with one option is taken without asking.

## The two presets

Spawned by Main (`defender_count` / `invader_count`, default 1 each):
- **Defender** — `ai/npc_defender.tscn` (faction `household`): `hostile_on_trespass` +
  `hostile_on_attack`, `defend_territory` (combat options stay inside the house), familiar with the
  house. Dropped at a clear spot in a random room (never inside solid furniture or on another defender).
- **Invader** — `ai/npc_invader.tscn`, an inherited scene overriding only data (faction
  `invader`): `hostile_on_sight`, not territorial, unfamiliar with the house (it learns rooms by
  sight and is offered unexplored areas by direction), a red body. Dropped just outside the house;
  several start spread around the perimeter and coordinate flanks over the callout radio. It enters rooms
  tactically (`entry_enabled`, `docs/tactical-entry.md`): stack beside the door, slice the pie, cross
  without stopping, take the corners, clear, leave rear security — as a team over the radio, or alone. A quiet stack that carries a stun
  listens at the stack before the pie (`entry_listen_time` 3 s, an **Entry** group export: E17, issue #51 R17), so a late reason can turn it into a bang.

Both pursue hostiles (`pursue_hostiles`, default on): IDLE is never offered and a known hostile sends
every decision straight to COMBAT.

Both know their ammo: the snapshot's `loadout` section and the `gun_loaded` / `weapon_low` / `can_reload` facts feed a RELOAD
tactic in the decision tree, the `reload` primitive runs it, and the `auto_reload` export (default on) reloads an empty gun
as a reflex. `low_ammo_fraction` sets where "nearly empty" starts.

Nothing in the AI is written per weapon: it fights with `Character.gun_slot()` (whatever gun it carries — the presets hold a pistol, but a match
arms every NPC with a gun from its side's loadout, one random gun by default) and reacts only to generic conditions the character reports. Notably, when its gun cannot fire because the
barrel is against a wall or object (`weapon_blocked()`, a long gun), it steps back until it can; a pistol is never blocked. See `domain-ai-behavior`.

## Key idea: Von picks, perceptions inform, behaviour executes

Von ranks distinct, verb-like options well but cannot do arithmetic or compare near-identical spatial
points, so every level offers a few DISTINCT options whose text carries the deciding facts as bands
("short hidden route", "in pistol range", "held by Invader2"). The NPC acts only on what it has
PERCEIVED: it fights a hostile's last-KNOWN position, loses a contact once its sighting decays (it
becomes an investigation lead), and (unless `familiar_with_house`) must see rooms/objects before it can
use them. The detail lives in `domain-ai-perception`, `domain-ai-decision` and `domain-ai-behavior`.

**Interfaces:** 3 (`Explosion.shields` / `first_stop`, the blast's cover rule perception asks of a grenade), 6 (`ItemRegistry`'s
slot ids, `throw_stats()`, `aim_target()`), 7 (Character ↔ Controller, the observer reads and overlay exports), 9 (AI → Navigation), 10 (EventBus), 11 (`PhysicsLayers`, `GameClock`), 13 (`DecisionStub` / `DecisionServerLauncher` for tests), 15 (`GameLog`: the decision log line, entry phases, the Von launcher), 17 (the human's `PlayerStack`), 21 (the `Squad`: leader, succession, orders) — signatures in `architecture`.
