name: domain-art
description: Deep implementation detail for the Art domain (scenes/art/) — the procedural top-down pixel-art engine every painter draws through: PixelCanvas (the drawing surface, shapes, shading, material finishes), PixelArt (the cached renderer, cardinal vs. freely turning art, lighting steps) and the two holders ArtCanvasConfig (the art pixel, light, turn steps, shadows) and ArtSurfaceConfig (tones, surface textures). Use when editing scenes/art/, writing or debugging any painter (furniture, walls, floors, characters, held items, vehicles), or tuning the shared pixel-art look. Complements the `architecture` skill, which holds the cross-domain interfaces.

# Art domain

A leaf: the pixel-art engine. It knows nothing about furniture, characters or items — each domain
owns its own **painters** and renders them through this domain. Depends only on Godot's `Image`.

## Painters

A painter is any script with
`static func paint(canvas: PixelCanvas, base: Color, material: String, opts: Dictionary)`. It
draws in a **canonical frame** — front toward +y, width across the front — under `canvas.light`,
the world light already turned into that frame, so its shading lands correctly after the art is
turned. Painters live in their own domain: Objects (`objects/art/*_painter.gd` + the `ObjectArt`
registry: the furniture (the cyberpunk rooms' `tech`, `recliner`, `clinic`, `security` and `hotplate` among them), the `streetlight` (its post,
and with `part: "overhang"` its arm and head drawn overhead), `decor` (clutter, neon tubes), the tiling `floor`, `street` and `wall`,
and `wear` (world-placed marks), all in the run-down look through the shared `decay.gd`), Character (`character/body/art/body_painter.gd`, `head_painter.gd`, `hand_painter.gd`, `limb_painter.gd`, `torso_painter.gd`,
`vest_painter.gd`), Items (`items/art/`, one painter per weapon style for the guns, held and lying dropped, `police_gun_painter.gd`,
`scrap_gun_painter.gd`, `pipe_gun_painter.gd`, and for the frag and stun grenades, `police_grenade_painter.gd`, `scrap_grenade_painter.gd`,
`pipe_grenade_painter.gd`, through the shared `weapon_art.gd`; and the spoon's `spoon_painter.gd`), Vehicles (`vehicle/art/car_painter.gd`, `van_painter.gd`, `door_painter.gd`, `wheel_painter.gd`, `lamp_painter.gd`, through
the shared `vehicle_art.gd`; see `domain-vehicle`). Knobs follow `opts.get(key, <DomainConfig>.<painter>_<key>)`.

## PixelArt (`pixel_art.gd`) — the renderer

- `render(painter, size, color, facing := Vector2.DOWN, opts := {})` — the surface finish rides in `opts.material`
  (handed to the painter as its `material`, the rest as its `opts`; the cache key holds it in a field of its own). For a cardinal `facing`: paints at
  `size / ArtCanvasConfig.pixel_size`, lit for that facing, then turns the image (`rotate_90/180`).
  Furniture, walls, floor tiles.
- `render_turned(painter, size, color, angle, opts := {})` — the image stays canonical but is
  lit as if turned by `angle`; the caller draws it rotated (`draw_set_transform`, or
  `Deformation.draw_shape` with its `ShapeLook.texture_angle`). Callers pass `snap_angle(angle)` (one of
  `ArtCanvasConfig.turn_steps` lighting steps) and rotate to the exact angle when drawing — smooth
  turning, few cached textures, world-consistent light. Characters, hands, the guns, a vehicle's body, doors, wheels and lamps.
- `emissive(painter, size, color, facing := Vector2.DOWN, opts := {})` — the emissive twin of `render`'s texture for the same inputs: what
  the painter drew `glowing` (PixelCanvas), in the art's colours, transparent elsewhere, same size and turn; null when nothing in
  it glows. Kept from the same paint (`_emissive`, beside `_cache`), so asking costs no second paint. `render_turned` keeps none.
- `handle(look) -> int` / `look_of(opts) -> Dictionary` — a painter's big look (a character style's resolved look, a gun's or
  grenade's `looks` row) travels in its options as an int (`opts.look`), never the dict: the caches key by the options and
  `render_turned` hashes them every call. `handle` registers the look under its hash (so the same look has the same handle and a
  cached texture keyed by it is that look's); `look_of` reads it back, {} for none. The Character and Items painters use it.
- Static cache keyed by painter path + inputs (+ orientation); survives scene reloads. Each
  piece's random detail is seeded by its inputs *without* orientation, so it doesn't change as the
  piece turns.
- `render_turned` sits behind a bounded memo (`_turned_memo`, `TURNED_MEMO_MAX` entries) keyed by the call's exact arguments, so
  a repeat call (a character repaints every part every frame) costs one lookup instead of formatting the key string. It only
  shortcuts the string-keyed cache: values that key treats as equal (an angle within four decimals) still share one texture
  (`tests/art/pixel_art_turned_cache_test.gd`).

## PixelCanvas (`pixel_canvas.gd`) — the surface

An RGBA8 Image at art resolution plus coverage and height layers (R8 images filled natively, read
through snapshots).
- **Shapes:** `rounded(r, radius)`, `ellipse(r)`, `disc(c, radius)` are `ConvexShape`s (one span
  per row/column: native row fills, O(1) depth-from-edge + normal, edge band enumerated
  directly); `bowed(r, radius, bow)` is a mask `Shape` (run-length sweeps).
- **Cost:** a mask `Shape` tests every pixel of its bounds when built and keeps a per-pixel mask, depth and normal (eight
  sweeps of its inside pixels, on first use), and hands `bevel` / `outline` only its edge band (`edge_pixels(k)`: depth 1..k),
  pinned to the plain per-pixel scan by `tests/art/shape_edges_match_plain_scan_test.gd`; a
  `ConvexShape` keeps one span per row and per column, so its fill, bevel and outline cost its edge. A shape that is convex along
  both axes but not a rounded rect or ellipse can be built from outside with `PixelCanvas.ConvexShape.new(rect, x0, x1, y0, y1)`
  (per row: first inside x and one past the last; per column the same in y): the Vehicles domain's `vehicle_art.convex` does, once
  per geometry, for its windscreens and side windows. `cast_shadows()` walks the whole canvas, so a large canvas painted for every
  lighting step (a vehicle body) skips it and shades with bevels.
- **Drawing:** `fill(shape, color, height)`, `clear`, `paint_over(rect, color)`, `line`, `px`; the static
  `line_points(a, b)` (a 1 px line's Bresenham points, `a` first) is the one line walk, also for a painter that blends or clips
  each point itself (Objects' `decay.gd` `line` / `scratches`).
- **What gives light:** `glowing(draw: Callable, area := Rect2i())` runs a drawing (a screen's face, a tube, a bulb, an LED)
  and marks every pixel it changed within `area` (the whole canvas when empty) as emissive; `emissive()` returns those pixels as
  they stand in the finished art (null when none). It compares the image before and after (skipping the rows left as they
  were), so pass a small `area` for a small drawing on a big canvas. Nothing else in the engine reads it: `PixelArt.emissive`
  hands it to callers. `tests/art/glowing_marks_changed_pixels_test.gd` pins the marks to the plain per-pixel comparison.
- **Reading coverage:** `covered(x, y)` for a pixel; `coverage()` (a snapshot: one byte per pixel, `y * w + x`, non-zero where
  drawn) for a painter that reads every pixel's neighbourhood (Objects' neon strip), where a `covered` call per pixel is slow.
- **Shading:** `bevel(shape, from_k, to_k, lit, unlit)` (light-facing edges lit, far edges
  shaded; swap for a recess), `bevel_relative` / `outline_relative` (shade what's drawn — shapes
  in several colors), `outline`, `glare`, `cast_shadows()` (a taller part shades lower pixels on
  its far side from the light, via the height layer), `tones(base)` (outline … highlight ramp).
- **Surface finishes:** `surface(shape, material, base, along_x, wraps)` — wood grain, brushed
  metal, stone flecks, ceramic/glass glare, fabric weave, plastic grain — plus `speckle` (sampled;
  matches 8-bit pixels with a tolerance), `grain(s, density, dark, pale, opts := {})` (`opts.along_x`, default true,
  `opts.wraps` for seamless tiles) / `knot`.

## ArtCanvasConfig and ArtSurfaceConfig (`art_canvas_config.gd`, `art_surface_config.gd`)

Shared tuning in two holders. `ArtCanvasConfig`, what every painting shares: `pixel_size`, `light_from`, `turn_steps`, drop
shadow (`drop_shadow_per_coverage`, `drop_shadow_max` — read by the object and vehicle visuals; `drop_shadow_alpha` — also by
the character, a dropped item and a grenade) and cast shadow. `ArtSurfaceConfig`, how a surface is shaded: the tone ramp and the
surface-finish densities. Domain-specific proportions and colors stay in
each domain's config (`ObjectArtConfig`, `CharacterConfig.art_*`).

**Interfaces:** 12 (Objects / Character / Items / Vehicles → Art) and 13 (a sandbox's own painter, e.g. a `ticket-assets`
showroom) — signatures in `architecture`.
