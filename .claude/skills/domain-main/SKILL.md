description: Deep implementation detail for the composition root (scenes/main.gd, scenes/main.tscn, scenes/match_spawner.gd) — the one place that wires every domain: the pre-game setup flow (Start / Watch / Endless / Tests / Settings), awaiting the Von decision server, building one match under a World node (house, nav map and re-baker, the dusk lighting, NPC placement, loadout arming, the squads and the human leader's command menu, match HUD, spectator inspector, debug overlays), endless-run teardown and randomisation, the settings page wiring, and the Main exports. Use when editing main.gd or match_spawner.gd, or working on match start-up, spawn placement rules, loadout arming, the endless run or how the overlays are toggled. Complements the `architecture` skill (interfaces 1, 9, 13, 14, 20, 21).

# Main — the composition root (`scenes/main.gd`, `main.tscn`, `match_spawner.gd`)

`main.gd` (with the Testing domain's runner, interface 13) is the only code that knows every domain; nothing depends on it. It owns no
gameplay of its own: it asks World-Gen for a house, places NPCs, arms characters, and attaches the HUDs and overlays. The exports on
the `Main` node are the authoring surface for a run (`house_seed`, `force_plan`, `entrance_distance`, `defender_count`, `invader_count`,
`invader_margin`, `spawn_clearance`, `spectator_mode`, `player_side`, `defender_loadout` / `invader_loadout`, `endless_delay`,
`endless_time_limit`, `debug_overlays`, and `show_agent_labels` / `show_agent_paths` / `show_vision` / `show_tactics` /
`show_room_zones` / `show_search` / `show_nav_holes`: seven of the overlays, the rest start at the registry's default).

## Setup flow

On a fresh launch Main loads the saved settings (`Settings.load_file()` after seeding `Settings.debug` from its export, so the headless test
runner never reads a developer's file), opens the UI setup window (`domain-ui-menus`) and builds nothing until a start button is pressed.
A scripted `restart` (the dev command server) sets the Engine `skip_setup` meta so the reloaded scene builds at once. The window offers:

- **Start** — a human joins the chosen side, on top of its NPC count, with the side's loadout and faction; with **Lead the team** ticked (the
  window's `lead`, read in `_on_setup_chosen` into `_lead`, a played match only) the human leads its side's squad (`docs/leadership.md` LD10);
- **Watch** — AIs alone (spectator mode);
- **Endless** — AIs alone; 5 s after each match ends (the MatchHUD's `match_ended`) Main frees its `World` node and builds a fresh match with
  a new seed, random counts up to the chosen ones and random loadouts (`LoadoutConfig.random`: a gun and an outfit per side, the grenade counts it was
  set up with); an undecided match is called a draw after `endless_time_limit`;
- **Tests** — changes scene to `testing/test_browser.tscn`; **Settings** — opens the settings page over the window.

The window gets `weapons`, `grenades` and `outfits` (`LoadoutConfig.options()` / `grenade_options()` / `outfit_options()`) and each side's defaults
from `_side_defaults` (`LoadoutConfig.normalize` of the side's loadout, so `outfit` included); `_side_loadout` copies the window's `weapon`, `magazine`,
`spares`, `stuns`, `frags` and `outfit` back into the side's loadout.
Main saves the window's choices (`Settings.set_setup`, the outfit and `lead` with them) on Start, Tests and Escape and feeds them back into the window's defaults
(`_with_saved_setup`: a choice an older save does not name, such as the outfit, keeps its default).
Before `_spawn_world()` it **awaits the AI domain's `DecisionServerLauncher.resolved(live)`**, so no NPC makes its first decision against a
still-booting Von server; the launcher is a root node of `main.tscn`, probes at scene load and always resolves (a run with no server still
starts, with NPCs that hold steady). The settings page is wired here (interface 14): Main applies each `SettingsMenu` signal to `Settings`
and answers with `set_rows`.

## Building one match (`_spawn_world`)

Everything one match builds lives under a fresh `World` node (group `match_world`), so `_teardown_world` can free it in place:

1. resolve `house_seed` (0 → random) (logged by `WorldGen.generate`); `WorldGen.generate(seed, force_plan, front_entrance, world)`; `WorldGen.get_rooms`;
2. `NavBuilder.build` the nav map, the `nav_debug.gd` overlay and the `nav_updater.gd` re-baker (interface 9), then the dusk
   lighting: `WorldLighting.light(_world, house_seed, rooms)` (interface 20, `docs/lighting.md`: the ambient, the sky, the pieces'
   lights and the room fixtures, the flashes), under `World` so a teardown frees it; the characters spawned after it cast their own
   shadows (their occluders) and are followed by it through the group `characters`;
3. a `match_spawner.gd` instance places the NPCs from one RNG seeded with the house seed (see below);
4. a human, when there is one, joins its side (`_join_player`: a clear spot for a defender, the scene anchor for an invader) and is reparented
   under `World` (draw order house < player < NPCs), is handed the stack radio (`MatchSpawner.bind_player` attaches a `PlayerStack` with the
   house's rooms and openings) and `_build_stack_markers` adds the floor markers (`StackMarkers`, `watch`ing it) under `World` (`docs/tactical-entry.md` E16);
   `_build_stun_screen` then names the human the listener (`Sound.focus = _player`, the Audio autoload's one input from Main: a bang's muffle and tinnitus are
   the human's alone) and adds the `StunScreen` (UI hud) under `World`, `watch`ing the player (`docs/grenades.md` G14). A spectator match has no human, so `Sound.focus`
   stays null; `_teardown_world` clears it;
5. `_arm_characters`: every character gets its side's loadout through `LoadoutConfig.apply` → `Character.set_loadout` and `Character.set_outfit` — a chosen gun with its
   magazine and spares, its stun / frag grenade counts and its outfit (`docs/outfits.md` O11). By default invaders carry 1 + 1 grenades and wear a helmet, a shirt,
   a plate carrier with a steel III plate front and back, tactical pants and boots (`invader_loadout`'s default `{ stuns: 1, frags: 1, outfit: { … } }`); defenders
   0 + 0 in plain clothes (`defender_loadout` `{}`, so `LoadoutConfig.default_outfit`: a t-shirt, jeans and shoes). The gun is the chosen one or by default
   one random gun drawn from an RNG seeded with the house seed XOR `LOADOUT_SEED_SALT`, so a pinned seed pins the loadouts without shifting placement. Each is
   styled as it is armed (`docs/outfits.md` O15), from a second RNG seeded with the house seed XOR `STYLE_SEED_SALT` (so the styles never shift the guns):
   its first draw is the match's police unit, one of the `CharacterConfig.styles` whose `side` is the invaders' (`zenitex`, `trauma`), worn by every invader,
   the human invader too, the first of them its lead (`rank` 2) and the second its sergeant (1) (with "Lead the team" on, a human invader is the lead
   and the NPC invaders are ranked from the sergeant down, the draws unchanged: LD10); each defender, the human defender too, draws one of the
   defenders' styles (`merc`, `borg`), a look seed of its own and one of its style's `weapons` (`scrap`, `pipe`; an invader's is `police`), all handed to
   `LoadoutConfig.apply` as its `style` (`{ look, seed, rank, weapon }`). Tests and sandboxes never come through here and keep the weapon they ask for;
6. `_build_squads(combatants, rooms)`: one `Squad` (`ai/team/squad.gd`, interface 21, `docs/leadership.md`) per side under `World`, over that side's
   combatants in spawn order (after `_arm_characters`, which ranks the unit), with `_spawner.openings` and the house's `rooms` (and the human as
   `human` when it leads, and the claim ttl `_spawner.callout_ttl_of(members)`, the side's NPCs' `callout_ttl`), kept in `_squads` by faction;
   each member is handed its squad (`MatchSpawner.bind_squad`: an NPC's controller, and the human's `PlayerStack`, the node `bind_player` returned,
   kept in `_player_stack`, whose claims then say `leader` while the human leads, LD17). The leader is the squad's own
   rule (rank, then spawn order), or the human when it leads. Then `_watch_side_stacks()`: in a played match the `StackMarkers` under `World`
   `watch_squad(squad.view)` the human's side's squad, lead or not, so every stack that side forms shows its rings (LD18). Then, in every match, `_build_leader_overlay()`: the `LeaderOverlay` (UI
   overlays, `watch` over every squad's `view`) under `World`, its `show_leaders` from `_overlay_flags` (the global `OverlayRegistry.LEADERS`
   row; `_on_overlay_toggled` sets it live, `_teardown_world` drops it): a crown over each side's leader while on. Then, in a played match, `_build_command_menu(rooms)`: when the human leads, the
   `OrderMarkers` (UI hud, `watch(squad.view)`) and the `CommandMenu` (UI hud, `setup({ rooms, teammates, view, resolve, leader })`, the squad's `view` and `resolve`) under
   `World`, the menu's `order_requested` connected to the squad's `issue` and its `selection_changed` to the markers' `set_selection`
   (interface 21, LD11, LD12); nothing is built otherwise, so nothing reads the right button;
7. `_configure_debug`, `MatchHUD.begin(combatants, time_limit)`, in spectator mode the camera framing + `SpectatorInspector`
   (`setup(combatants, flags, OverlayToggles.RESERVED_WIDTH)`: the width its outfit panel keeps clear; the player and its panel are freed), and the performance overlay + overlay toggle bar when Debug is on (built once, kept across an endless run).

Overlay flags live in `_overlay_flags` (one entry per row of `OverlayRegistry`), seeded by `_initial_overlays`: the registry's defaults, then the
`show_*` exports, then the player's saved toggles (`Settings.overlays`), which win over the exports; with Debug off every flag starts off.
`_on_overlay_toggled` saves each flip with `Settings.set_overlay` and applies it live — the navigation holes (furniture and characters at rest) to
the single NavDebug, the performance flag to its overlay, spectator mode via `SpectatorInspector.set_flag`, otherwise to every NPC's overlay
nodes by duck-typed `show_<x>` property through `OverlayRegistry.apply` (`domain-ui-overlays`).

## NPC placement (`match_spawner.gd`, a `RefCounted`)

Main builds one per match and sets `world`, `spawn_clearance` and `invader_margin` on it; it keeps the list `combatants` that the camera, HUD,
inspector and overlays observe.

- `spawn_defender(rooms, rng, index)` — a random room; `clear_spot(rect, rng)` returns its centre when clear, else the first clear point of
  `SPAWN_TRIES` (32) drawn from the rng (inset from the walls). **Clear** = at least `spawn_clearance` from every solid furniture footprint
  (`NavBuilder.furniture_holes`, read off the shapes, so it is right on the frame the house is built) and twice that from every combatant already
  placed; the centre again when nothing is clear. (A body spawned inside a piece is ejected with it and the piece's momentum flings it.)
- `spawn_invader(rooms, rng, index, count, front_entrance)` — around the perimeter of the rooms' bounding box grown by `invader_margin`, one even
  fraction per index plus a little jitter, so several attackers start on different sides; the front entrance is injected so the controller heads
  straight for it.
- `add_npc` instances the scene, sets its position and only THEN adds it under `world` (a body added at the world origin and moved afterwards
  overlaps whatever stands there for a frame, and the physics launches that piece across the map), hands its controller the house `rooms`, its `openings` (the spawner's field, which `main.gd` sets from
  `WorldGen.get_openings` before spawning; for tactical entry) and `entry_point` through its controller, the child in the group `npc_controllers` (`bind_npc`), and appends it to `combatants`; `bind_squad(member, squad, stack := null)` hands an NPC its side's squad (its
  controller's `squad`) the same way, and the human's `PlayerStack` (`stack`, the node `bind_player` returned) its `squad`; `callout_ttl_of(members)`
  is the `callout_ttl` of the first NPC among them (0 with none), which Main hands `Squad.setup`; `bind_player(player, rooms)` does the human's equivalent (a `PlayerStack`); the first of a kind is named plainly (`Defender`, `Invader`), the rest `<base> 2`, …
- Tests of the leadership wiring: `tests/general/lead_rank_test.gd` (LD10: the ranks with and without "Lead the team", the same style draws, `lead`
  saved), `command_menu_wiring_test.gd` (LD11: a Main-built match, the menu orders a stun stack and both NPCs claim in bang mode; LD13 / LD16: ordered
  with "Hold for my go" ticked it holds until the menu's "Go into the kitchen", then bangs and goes in),
  `squad_leader_rule_test.gd` and `squad_succession_test.gd` (LD3, LD4).
- Test: `tests/general/match_spawn_clear_test.gd` (two defenders in a room with a bed over its centre start clear and apart);
  `match_spawn_origin_test.gd` (a counter against the world origin is not launched by a spawn); `stack_player_wiring_test.gd` (`bind_player` attaches the stack with the house's doorways); `match_setup_test.gd`
  covers the setup dicts, loadout arming and the endless randomisation; `match_styles_test.gd` the crews' styles (one unit per match from the seed, defenders mixed,
  every item in its wielder's weapon style).
